CACE is a set of python scripts that take an input file in the
CACE 4.0 format and uses the information found there in combination with CACE-compatible testbenches and analysis scripts to characterize a circuit and to produce a datasheet showing the circuit performance.

## Installation

You'll need the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher with PIP and Tkinter

CACE can be installed directly from PyPI:

	$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade cace
Prerequisite design tools:

- xschem:  [https://github.com/stefanschippers/xschem](https://github.com/stefanschippers/xschem)
- ngspice: git://git.code.sf.net/p/ngspice/ngspice
- magic:	 [https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic)

## Usage

If installed as Python package, CACE can be started from the command line using:

```
$ cace
```

Or to start the GUI:

```
$ cace-gui
```

Information on how to use CACE can be found in the documentation at [cace.readthedocs.io](https://cace.readthedocs.io/). 

## Development

### Dependencies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may need to set up a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

To install the dependencies for CACE, run:

	$ make dependencies

### Python Package

To build the Python package, run:

```
$ make build
```

To install the package, run:

```
$ make install
```

To install the package in editable mode, run:

```
$ make editable
```

### Documentation

To build the documentation, run:

```
$ make docs
```

To host the docs, run:

```
make host-docs
```

> [!NOTE]
> The documentation can be viewed online at [cace.readthedocs.io](https://cace.readthedocs.io/). 

## CACE GUI syntax

    $ cace-gui [path/to/project.txt]

	where optional file project.txt (normally <name_of_project>.txt
	where <name_of_project> is the name of the circuit to be
	characterized) is a circuit characterization description in the
	file format described below.  If a file is not specified, then
	the GUI window will come up without content.  Click on the button
	with text "(no selection)" to find and select a characterization
	file to load.  The project file may also be in JSON format.

	Normally, cace_gui.py is called from a project top level directory,
	while the project.txt file is usually in a subdirectory called
	cace/.  The project.txt file may be the output file from a CACE
	run, which will add results to all of the parameter entries.

	There may be multiple characterization files in a single project
	(repository), as a project may contain multiple subcircuits that
	may need independent characterization or be able to be used as
	standalone circuits, or a project may simply be a collection of
	circuits (library) without a specific single top level. 

## CACE command line syntax

	$ cace <filename_in> <filename_out> [options]

	where <filename_in> is a format 4.0 ASCII CACE file
	and <filename_out> is the name of the file to write.

	Options may be one of:

	  -source=schematic|layout|rcx|all|best
	  -param=<parameter_name>
	  -force
	  -json
	  -keep
	  -debug
	  -sequential
	  -summary

	When run from the top level, this program parses the CACE
	characterization file, runs simulations, and outputs a
	modified file annotated with characterization results.

	With option "-source", restrict characterization to the
	specific netlist source, which is either schematic capture,
	layout extracted, or full R-C parasitic extracted.  If not
	specified, then characterization is run on the full R-C
	parasitic extracted layout netlist if available, and the
	schematic captured netlist if not (option "best").

	Option "-param=<parameter_name>" runs simulations on only
	the named electrical or physical parameter.

	Option "-force" forces new regeneration of all netlists.

	Option "-json" generates an output file in JSON format.

	Option "-keep" retains files generated for characterization.

	Option "-noplot" will not generate any graphs.

	Option "-debug" generates additional diagnostic output.

	Option "-sequential" runs simulations sequentially.

	Option "-nosim" does not re-run simulations if the output file exists.
	   (Warning---does not check if simulations are out of date).

	Option "-summary" prints a summary of results at the end.

## Examples

The following repositories contain example circuit designs, each having a "cace/" subdirectory with a specification input file in the format described below, and a set of testbench schematics which are used by CACE to measure all specified electrical and physical parameters, generate results, and analyze them to determine circuit performance over corners.

> [!NOTE]
> Example repositories, like CACE itself, are currently a work in progress.

All repositories are rooted at: [https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/).

Example circuit repositories:

- [sky130_ef_ip__instramp](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/sky130_ef_ip__instramp)		Instrumentation amplifier
- [sky130_ef_ip__rdac3v_8bit](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/sky130_ef_ip__rdac3v_8bit)	8-bit resistor ladder DAC
- sky130_ef_ip__samplehold	sample-and-hold circuit
- sky130_ef_ip__driveramp		Rail-to-rail driver amplifier
- sky130_ef_ip__ccomp3v		Rail-to-rail continuous comparator
- sky130_ef_ip__rc_osc_500k	R-C oscillator, 500kHz nominal output
- sky130_ef_ip__xtal_osc_16M	Crystal oscillator, 4 to 15MHz
- sky130_ef_ip__xtal_osc_32k	Crystal oscillator, 32kHz

Each of these repositories contains a circuit designed with the SkyWater sky130 process open PDK, and contains schematics, layout, and CACE characterization.

NOTE:  These repositories are a work in progress, and may not exist yet or may not have a characterization setup for CACE.
