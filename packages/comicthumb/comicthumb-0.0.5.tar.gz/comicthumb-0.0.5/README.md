# Comicthumb

This is a very basic port of the
[comicthumb](https://sourceforge.net/p/comix/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/mime/comicthumb)
utility that came with comix.  Arch users do not get this utility by default
with the better maintained fork, mcomix. This "just werks on my machine" but if
it doesn't work on yours submit a pull request please.
