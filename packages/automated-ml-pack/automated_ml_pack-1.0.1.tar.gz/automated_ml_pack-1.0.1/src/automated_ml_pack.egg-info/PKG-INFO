# MLPackageManager
## _A Comprehensive Package for Automated Machine Learning_
[![scikit-learn](https://github.com/CyrilleMesue/archives/blob/main/images/mlpack.png?raw=true)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**Project Overview:**
The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline capable of handling data ingestion, transformation, model training, and evaluation for both regression and classification tasks. Additionally, a user-friendly web application has been developed to facilitate predictions based on the trained models. The entire pipeline has been deployed to ensure accessibility and scalability.

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```


## Tutorials
