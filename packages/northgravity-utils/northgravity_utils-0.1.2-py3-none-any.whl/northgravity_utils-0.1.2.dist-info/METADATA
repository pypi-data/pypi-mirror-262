# NORTH GRAVITY PYTHON UTILS #

This document describes the North Gravity Python Utils package which enables users to use the North Gravity platform tools and most common functions within their python scripts / tasks repositories. 

The Python Utils can be used within:

- a single python script that is ran thanks to the Python Runner task within a pipeline in the North Gravity application

- a single Jupyter Notebook that is ran thanks to the Jupyter Runner task within a pipeline in the North Gravity application

- an ensemble of python scripts that are part of a container, for a Task created by the user, used in a pipeline in the North Gravity application

 

NG_Utils cover most frequently used functions for data/files handling purposes.

The scope of the NG_Utils:

- **DataHandler** - splitting data based on train/test labels, handling dates in datasets  

- **FileHandler** - downloading/uploading model-specific datasets from/to the data lake, handling datasets formats

- **BackTest** - preparing short or extended backtest based on models results

- **StatTest** - preparing report and running statistical tests for stationarity, autocorrelation and volatitity clustering

-**TaskExecUtils** - auxiliary functions used in executing tasks 




## How to install and set the package: 
### Install
```text
pip3 install northgravity_utils==0.1.2
```
As the library is available from pip, it can be installed as a specific version within a Python Task from within requirements.txt just by adding:
```text
northgravity_utils==0.1.2
```
The package relies on the requests library so, in the project, the user must install this library in the requirements.txt file.
```text
pip3 install requests==2.27.1
```


### Environment Variables
The package uses information from the environment variables. They are necessery for functionality of Nortygravity SDK package, used in Northgravity Utils
Environment variables are automatically provided when running a script within a pipeline (as a Task or within the Python/Jupyter Runners).
If running locally the script, users must set them in the project to be able to run the project locally.


Mandatory environment variables to set:

- NG_API_ENDPOINT → the URL to the North Gravity platform API (by default, the url is set to https://api.northgravity.com)


- LOGIN → login received from North Gravity

- PASSWORD → password to log in,
  
- or NG_API_KEY → API key to use instead of LOGIN and PASSWORD combination
    
Credentials are used to generate the token so that each request is authenticated.
