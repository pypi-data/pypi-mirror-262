# Note: only this version has to be bumped for the whole puma project
# to publish new version: (pre-requisite: conda install gh -c conda-forge)
# - bump version below
# - git add -A
# - git commit -m 'Version bumped'
# - git push nasa main
# - git tag -a v$(python setup.py --version) -m 'INPUT DESCRIPTION'
# - gh release create v$(python setup.py --version) --target main
