This directory contains some examples that demonstrate
how you can use the TuLiP toolbox.
Organization is by topic matter or relevant part of the API;
summaries of files and subdirectories are given below.

- `discrete.py` - discrete transition model
- `gr1.py` - alternative system description directly using `GRSpec`
- `gr1_set.py` - how to use an integer variable in gr1

mode switching (discrete state space):
    `controlled_switching.py` - both transitions and modes controlled
    `environment_switching.py` - env controls modes, sys controls transitions
    `only_mode_controlled.py` - sys controls modes, env controls transitions
    `hybrid.py` - (env, sys) control modes, sys controls transitions

continuous state space (discrete-time dynamics):
    `continuous.py` - continuous dynamics (with abstraction)
    `pwa.py` - modification to include pwa dynamics

In each of the examples, the task involves repeatedly visiting a cell,
responding to a parking signal, and avoiding an environmental obstacle.


* `gridworlds/` - planning on grids to reach goals while avoiding obstacles
* `developer/` - various examples used during development, unstable directory
* `developer/transys/` - examples focusing on the `tulip.transys` subpackage
* `developer/interfaces/` - demonstrations of interfaces to tools outside Python
