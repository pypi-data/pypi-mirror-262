# USPS Addresses API 3.0

The Addresses API validates and corrects address information, eliminating errors, improving package delivery service and package pricing. This suite of APIs provides different utilities for addressing components. The ZIP Code™ lookup finds valid ZIP Code™ for a City and State. The City/State lookup provides the valid cities and states for a provided ZIP Code™. The Address Standardization API validates and standardizes USPS® domestic addresses, city and state names, and ZIP Code™ in accordance with USPS® addressing standards. The USPS® address standard includes the ZIP + 4®, signifying a USPS® delivery point, given a street address, a city and a state.
