   <p>HoneyHive is a model observability and evaluation platform that helps you continuously improve your models in production. We help you evaluate, deploy, monitor and fine-tune both closed and open-source large language models for production use-cases, allowing you to optimize model performance & align your models with your usersâ€™ preferences.</p>

## SDK Installation

```bash
pip install honeyhive
```

## Authentication

After signing up on the app, you can find your API key in the [Settings page](https://app.honeyhive.ai/settings/account).

```python
import honeyhive
honeyhive.api_key = "HONEYHIVE_API_KEY"
honeyhive.openai_api_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

## Usage

Here we are assuming that you have a project setup in HoneyHive. If you don't, you can create one [here](https://app.honeyhive.ai/) by clicking on the `New Project` button.

### Generating a text completion via HoneyHive


#### Custom Prompt

Adding HoneyHive is as simple as changing `openai.Completions.create` to `honeyhive.Completions.create`. Just make sure to specify which project associated with the generation.

It's recommended to move the prompt to a template in our platform so that we can analyze user input distributions better.

```python
response = honeyhive.Completions.create(
  project="Sandbox - Email Writer",
  model="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Write an email to a colleague named Jill congratulating her on her promotion. The tone should be warm yet professional. Mention how you admire the work she's been putting in.  Include a joke about how her pet lizard Max enjoys eating grasshoppers. Mention how you're looking forward to the team off-site next week.",
  temperature=0,
  max_tokens=256,
  top_p=1,
  frequency_penalty=0,
  presence_penalty=0
)

generation_id = response.generation_id
```


#### Deployed Prompt

Assuming you have a prompt deployed for your project, you can generate it by calling `honeyhive.generations.generate(`

```python
response = honeyhive.generations.generate(
    task="PROJECT_NAME",
    input={
        "EXAMPLE1": "input",
        "EXAMPLE2": "input"
    }
)
```

#### Specific Prompt

If you want to generate a completion for a specific prompt, you can do so by calling `honeyhive.generations.generate(`

```python
response = honeyhive.generations.generate(
    task="PROJECT_NAME",
    input={
        "EXAMPLE1": "input",
        "EXAMPLE2": "input"
    },
    prompts=["PROMPT_NAME"]
)
```

### Evaluating a text completion via HoneyHive

For providing feedback on a generation, you can call `honeyhive.feedback(`

```python
response = honeyhive.feedback(
    task="PROJECT_NAME",
    generation_id=generation_id,
    feedback={
        "EXAMPLE1": "feedback",
        "EXAMPLE2": True,
    }
)
```
