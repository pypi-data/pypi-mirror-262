## Typing stubs for requests-oauthlib

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`requests-oauthlib`](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`requests-oauthlib`.

This version of `types-requests-oauthlib` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `requests-oauthlib==1.4.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/requests-oauthlib. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `449f70f1f1bc787eb56699a5ce153c3efbfe2f4f` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.354, and
pytype 2024.3.11.
