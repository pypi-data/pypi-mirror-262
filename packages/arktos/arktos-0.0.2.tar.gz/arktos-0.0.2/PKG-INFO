Description: # Arktos
        
        Arktos (ancient Greek word for Bear) is a utility designed to facilitate the transition from Pandas to Polars, allowing users to leverage Polars' performance benefits with a familiar Pandas-like interface.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install Arktos, simply run:
        
        ```bash
        pip install panpol
        ```
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        Here's a quick example to get you started with Arktos:
        
        ```
        import panpol as pp
        ```
        
        ## Example Usage
        
        Beyond simple file reading, Arktos simplifies more complex data manipulations. Here's an example of grouping data and calculating summary statistics:
        
        ```python
        import arktos as pp
        
        # Assuming 'data.csv' has columns 'category' and 'value'
        df = pp.read_csv('data.csv')
        
        # Group by 'category' and calculate the mean of 'value' for each group
        grouped_df = df.groupby('category').agg({'value': 'mean'})
        
        print(grouped_df)
        ```
        In this example, Arktos mimics the pandas groupby and aggregation method to calculate the mean of values within each category. It's a powerful feature for those coming from a pandas background looking to utilize the speed of Polars.
        
        
        
        ## Features
        - Easy transition from Pandas to Polars
        - High-performance data manipulation
        - Familiar syntax for Pandas users
