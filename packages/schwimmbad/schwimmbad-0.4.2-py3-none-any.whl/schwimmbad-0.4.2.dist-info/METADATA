`schwimmbad` provides a uniform interface to parallel processing pools and enables
switching easily between local development (e.g., serial processing or with
`multiprocessing`) and deployment on a cluster or supercomputer (via, e.g., MPI or
JobLib).

## Installation

The easiest way to install is via `pip`:

    pip install schwimmbad

See the [installation
instructions](http://schwimmbad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the
[documentation](http://schwimmbad.readthedocs.io) for more information.
