#### Installation

This is the environment we need to load.

``` bash

pip install ab_testing_module==3.1.7
```

#### Load Package

``` bash

from ab_testing_module import ab_test
```

#### Base Operations

``` bash

# Perform ab test or abc test
df_results = ab_test(data=df, 
                    group_column='group', 
                    value_column='outcome', 
                    control_group='control', 
                    alpha=0.05, 
                    handle_outliers=None, 
                    mc_correction=None)
```


The `ab_test` function performs statistical analysis to compare outcomes across different groups in an A/B testing framework.


- **`data`**: The dataset to analyze, provided as a Pandas DataFrame. It should contain at least two columns: one for grouping (e.g., experimental vs. control groups) and one for the outcomes of interest (e.g., conversion rates, scores).

- **`group_column`**: A string specifying the name of the column in `data` that contains the group labels. This column is used to differentiate between the groups involved in the A/B test (e.g., 'group').

- **`value_column`**: A string indicating the name of the column in `data` that contains the values or outcomes to be analyzed (e.g., 'outcome'). These values are the focus of the statistical comparison between groups.

- **`control_group`**: (Optional) A string specifying the label of the control group within the `group_column`. This argument is essential when the analysis involves comparing each test group against a common control group to assess the effect of different treatments or conditions.

- **`alpha`**: (Optional) A float representing the significance level used in the statistical tests. The default value is `0.05`, which is a common threshold for determining statistical significance. Lowering this value makes the criteria for significance stricter, while increasing it makes the criteria more lenient.

- **`handle_outliers`**: (Optional) A list specifying the method and strategy for handling outliers in the `value_column`. The first element of the list is the method ('IQR' for interquartile range or 'Z-score'), and the second element is the strategy ('remove', 'impute', or 'cap'). If `None`, no outlier handling is performed.

  - `IQR`: Identifies outliers based on the interquartile range. Typically, values below Q1-1.5*IQR or above Q3+1.5*IQR are considered outliers.
  - `Z-score`: Identifies outliers based on the Z-score, with values typically beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean considered outliers.
  - `remove`: Outliers are removed from the dataset.
  - `impute`: Outliers are replaced with a specified statistic (e.g., the median).
  - `cap`: Outliers are capped at a specified maximum and/or minimum value.

- **`mc_correction`**: (Optional) A string specifying the method for multiple comparisons correction when conducting multiple statistical tests. This argument is critical for controlling the family-wise error rate or the false discovery rate in experiments involving multiple group comparisons. Options include:

  - `None`: No correction is applied.
  - `'bonferroni'`: The Bonferroni correction, which adjusts p-values by multiplying them by the number of comparisons.
  - `'fdr'`: The False Discovery Rate correction, which controls the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected null hypotheses.
  - `'holm'`: The Holm-Bonferroni method, a step-down procedure that is less conservative than the standard Bonferroni correction.


- The function returns a Pandas DataFrame (`df_results`) containing the results of the statistical tests, including test names, p-values, effect sizes, power analyses (where applicable), and detailed interpretations of the results. The DataFrame provides a comprehensive summary of the findings from the A/B test analysis.
