# Skyhigh SSE Python module (MVC-Python)
### A Python class for Skyhigh Security Service Edge APIs

Project on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/MVC-Python

Project on GitHub: https://github.com/zengelan/MVC-Python

> [!NOTE]
> **Skyhigh SSE** is the successor of Skyhigh Networks CASB and McAfee Web Gateway Cloud Services. These products are now joined together and marketed by the brand **Skyhigh Security**

If you want to try out Skyhigh SSE register for one of these hands-on workshops: https://www.skyhighsecurity.com/lp/sse-virtual-hands-on-workshops.html

More information about the brand, the company and the solutions are available at: https://www.skyhighsecurity.com/

> [!TIP]
> Skyhigh SSE converges Secure Web Gateway (SWG), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Private Access (ZTNA), Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) into a single platform, Skyhigh Cloud Platform. Skyhigh SSE provides real-time data and threat protection against advanced and cloud-enabled threats and safeguards data across all vectors (web, cloud, email, and private apps) and users.

Documentation for the Skyhigh Security Service Edge Solution is available at https://success.skyhighsecurity.com/

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Eventually this project will be renamed to "skyhigh-sse-python" and all references to "McAfee" or "MVC" will be removed


## Prepreqs
You need to set the environment variable named `MVC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` to an OAuth ID that is accepted by Trellix IAM.
You can ask Skyhigh Security Sales Systems Engineer on how to get this ID, or extract it yourself from the login flow to the UI.
Set it as environment variable e.g. like this:

* `set MVC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=1234567890`  (Windows)
* `export MVC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=1234567890`   (Linux/Mac)
