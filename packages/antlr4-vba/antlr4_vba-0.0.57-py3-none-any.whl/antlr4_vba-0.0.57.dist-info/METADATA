# antlr4-vba

antlr4-vba is a package of the Lexer and Parser created by antlr with the command `antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 -listener -visitor vba.g4`. The project also includes the empty listener and visitor classes, which are largely useless on their own, but good as reference.
Similarly, there are grammar, lexer, and parser files which implement the conditional compilation process of VBA.

## Installation
The project can be installed with `python -m pip install antlr4-vba`

## Typing stubs
The project also includes typed stubs for mypy. These stubs are autogenerated by stubgen, so they may be incomplete. Please let me know if they do not meet your needs and I can manage them manually.
