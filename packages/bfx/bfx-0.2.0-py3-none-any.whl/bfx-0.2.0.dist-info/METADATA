> A suite for bioinformatics tools with little to no dependencies.

This WIP module offers several usefull bioinformatics tool for projects
that can't rely on large dependencies like BioPython or others.

This lightweight bioinformatics module is ideal for projects with limited dependencies. It includes fasta/fastq readers (supporting compressed files), BLOSUM matrices, and population genetics tools â€“ with more features on the way!
