# Bloomy Battery Simulator 1200 Python Driver
This package enables CAN communication to the Bloomy BS1200 through the PEAK Systems PCAN-USB FD adapter. 
To install latest public version use the command 'pip install bs1200'
To install via downloaded distributable open a command line in the dist directory and use the command 'pip install bs1200-X.X.X-py3-none-any.whl' where X.X.X is version of whl file.
Package is compatible with Windows and Unix platforms
Requires Python version 3.6 or greater
## Feature list

* Instantiate a CAN Bus supporting up to 16 Parallel BS1200 units

* HIL Mode Configuration
:   When in HIL mode, the Battery Simulator 1200 gives priority to the specified incoming frames to reduce latency; the instrument will attempt to pass non-HIL frames through for processing but delivery is not guaranteed. Before using, the CAN HIL Publishing Configuration must be set.

* Query BS1200 for board Temperatures and Fan Faults

* Individual Cell Control
     - Enable or Disable Cell
     - Set Cell Voltage
     - Readback Cell Voltage 
     - Set Cell Sinking and Sourcing Current Limits
     - Readback Cell Current 
     - Readback Cell Current 

* Enable/Disable all Cells
* Set all Cell Voltages
* Readback all Cell Voltages
* Set all Cell Sinking & Sourcing Limits
* Readback all Cell Currents
* Format strings for cell readbacks console printing

* Set Voltages for Analog Output Channels 1-2
* Readback Analog Input Channel
* Readback All Analog Input Channels
* Set direction and enable status for Digital Input/Output Channels 1-8
* Readback DIO Channels

### Upcoming/Planned Features
 * NI-XNET (CAN) USB adapter support
 * Ethernet (TCPIP/UDP) support 
## Installation
Install the package by saving the .whl file from the project releases page https://github.com/BloomyControls/BS1200-Python-Driver/releases/
Open command line, powershell, or another terminal to the location the .whl file was saved and run the following command to install using pip package manager
Windows:
```
pip install "\path\to\whl\file\BS1200_driver-X.X.X-py3-none-any.whl"
```
Linux:
```
pip3 install "/path/to/whl/file/BS1200_driver-X.X.X-py3-none-any.whl"
```
Alternative to downloading a release, the library may be built to the project /dist/ directory by running the command 
```
python -m build
```
from the same directory the project's pyproject.toml file is found, and install using pip from the freshly built .whl in the /dist/ directory.
## Use Instructions
Once the package has been installed to the python environment, the `BS1200` driver class may be used to communicate action statuses with target BS1200 units over a PCAN adapter, or to configure settings for a BS1200 at a designated IP address using the `ConfigTools` class. 
### BS1200 (driver)
The only required argument to the BS1200 class constructor is an integer list of the Box IDs the connected BS1200 units are configured to i.e.
```
from bs1200 import BS1200

test_unit = BS1200([1])
test_unit.query_system_status(1)
test_unit.close()
``` 
An equivalent statement using the Python 'with' structure can be used for the driver so that the communication session will be closed out automatically:
```
from bs1200 import BS1200

with BS1200([1]) as bs:
     bs.query_system_status(1)
```
Examples above are for a CAN Bus with a single BS1200 with the CAN Box ID set to 1.
Once the object is created, the PCAN bus is initialized and a communication session using the device channel PCAN_USBBUS1 has started. 

The `BS1200` Driver class has three optional arguments used to set the PCAN Bus configuration other than the listed default values:
```
pcan_channel = 'PCAN_USBBUS1', 
bit_rate = 1000000, 
delay_ms = 10
```  
Where `pcan_channel` is the name of the PCAN Interface on the system, `bit_rate` is the CAN Baud Rate (must match CAN Baud Rate configured on BS1200!!!), and `delay_ms` is delay in milliseconds that will be executed by the `can_wait()` class method. 

The aforementioned method is a public helper method that may be called explicitly, or optionally by providing a True value for the `wait` argument of action status methods which assign voltage or current setpoints. It is reccomended to wait the default value of 10 ms between sending new setpoints to the BS1200 and querying readback of cell values, so that updated CAN frames will be recieved to the cache of incoming frames. This delay value is closely tied to the `Write_Period_ms` property of the BS1200 configuration's `CAN_Settings`.
#### Action Status Methods
The following action status methods may then be used to interact with the BS1200 bus:
| Driver Method Name | Parameters | Description |

| hil_mode | **boxid (int):** Box ID of the target unit<br>**enable_HIL (bool):** True to enable HIL Mode, False to disable | Enable or disable the BS1200 in HIL mode. Returns PCAN bus OK status. Once set, the Battery Simulator will execute only the commands defined as active in HIL mode. By default all auxiliary configuration channels are set to disabled during HIL mode. In order to change this option, the configuration frame must be used. Note, the Configure frame is not supported in HIL mode, so this must be sent while HIL mode is disabled. |

This method or some other means of delay should be used between the setpoint and readback of cell values |
#### Format Strings
Three format strings `v_fmt_txt`, `i_fmt_txt`, and `ai_fmt_txt` are defined as class properties to provide clean console or text file outputs of cell voltage, current, and analog input voltage numeric arrays respectively. For example, with a BS1200 object named `bs` that is connected to a BS1200 with BoxID 1, the cell voltages may be printed to console (or written to log/report text file) using the following:
```
volts = bs.readback_V_all(1)
print(bs.v_fmt_txt.format(*volts))
```
To print a tabulated string output such as:
```
Cell 1: 1.002400 V |  Cell 2: 1.000800 V |  Cell 3: 0.998400 V | Cell 4:  0.000000 V
Cell 5: 0.000000 V |  Cell 6: 0.000000 V |  Cell 7: 0.000000 V | Cell 8:  0.000000 V
Cell 9: 0.000000 V | Cell 10: 0.000000 V | Cell 11: 0.000000 V | Cell 12: 0.000000 V
```
### ConfigTools
The features of the configuration mode seen in the BS1200 Soft Front Panel are available as a module of the b1200 python driver.
This module allows you to view and alter the Protocol, Ethernet, and CAN configurations for an individual BS1200 unit.
The configuration tools can be used with the following import statement
```
from bs1200 import ConfigTools
```
To apply individual categories can be used by importing the dataclasses used for each type of configuration
```
from bs1200 import ConfigTools, Ethernet_Settings, CAN_Settings, Protocol
```
By just importing the ConfigTools configuration settings may be read as a json object (optionally to a .json file) using get_all_settings(ExportToFile: bool) and apply_config_file(cfg_file_path: str).
BS1200 Configuration JSON object example:
```
{
    "Protocol": "CAN",
    "IP_Address": "192.168.1.100",
    "Ethernet_Settings": {
        "TCP_Cmd_Port": "12345",
        "TCP_Cmd_Interval_ms": "10",
        "UDP_Read_Port": "54321",
        "UDP_Read_Interval_ms": "5"
    },
    "CAN_Settings": {
        "Box_ID": 1,
        "Write_Period_ms": 5
    },
	"Enable_SafetyInterlock" : false
}
```
By default the methods used to set configuration values will restart the connected target using the NI System Configuration API. It is highly reccomended to restart the unit whenever updating values to prevent a desynchronization between the target IP address saved to class properties and currently used IP address of the device.
When restarting the target BS1200, the console will output status messages while the module waits for the `nisyscfg` restart method to return, signalling that the target is back online. The `ConfigTools` object will update to the newly set IP address so that further configuration may take place without needing to recreate the object.
