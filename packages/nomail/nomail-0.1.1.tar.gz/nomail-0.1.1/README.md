## Description

Customizable email filter for Gmail with Python.

## Why?

I am personally tired of sifting through the deluge of emails I
receive. I wanted to make a customizable email filter to extract
pertinent information and ignore the rest.

## Installation

1. Install with [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/nomail/)
    + `$ pip install nomail`

## Usage

```
Usage: nomail.py [OPTIONS]

  Filter out the noise.
