# cornsnake

A small library wrapping common Python utilities for working with files, git, ZIP, lists, processes, dates and times.

Functions that I find myself writing time and again, on various OSS and personal projects - so collecting in one place, in case it is of use!

For more details, see the [documentation](http://docs.mrseanryan.cornsnake.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/).
