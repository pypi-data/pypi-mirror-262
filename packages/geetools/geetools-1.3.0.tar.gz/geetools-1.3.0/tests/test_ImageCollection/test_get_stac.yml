description: 'See also collection COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED that shifts data with

  PROCESSING_BASELINE ''04.00'' or above (after 2022-01-25) to be in the same range

  as in older scenes.


  Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral

  imaging mission supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies,

  including the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover,

  as well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas.


  The Sentinel-2 L2 data are downloaded from scihub. They were

  computed by running sen2cor. WARNING: ESA did not produce L2 data

  for all L1 assets, and earlier L2 coverage is not global.


  The assets contain

  12 UINT16 spectral bands representing SR scaled by 10000 (unlike in L1 data,

  there is no B10). There are also several more L2-specific bands (see band

  list for details). See the

  [Sentinel-2 User Handbook](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/685211/Sentinel-2_User_Handbook)

  for details. In addition, three QA bands are present where one

  (QA60) is a bitmask band with cloud mask information. For more

  details, [see the full explanation of how cloud masks are computed.](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/level-1c/cloud-masks)


  EE asset ids for Sentinel-2 L2 assets have the following format:

  COPERNICUS/S2_SR/20151128T002653_20151128T102149_T56MNN. Here the

  first numeric part represents the sensing date and time, the

  second numeric part represents the product generation date and

  time, and the final 6-character string is a unique granule identifier

  indicating its UTM grid reference (see [MGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System)).


  For datasets to assist with cloud and/or cloud shadow detection, see [COPERNICUS/S2_CLOUD_PROBABILITY](COPERNICUS_S2_CLOUD_PROBABILITY)

  and [GOOGLE/CLOUD_SCORE_PLUS/V1/S2_HARMONIZED](GOOGLE_CLOUD_SCORE_PLUS_V1_S2_HARMONIZED).
