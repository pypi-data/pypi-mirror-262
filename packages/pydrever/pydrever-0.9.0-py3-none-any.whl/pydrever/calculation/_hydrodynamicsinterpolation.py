    """
    Private method to interpolate time series and add the target_time_steps to the list.

    Args:
        time_steps (list[float]): Original specification of the time steps of the hydrodynamic forcing.
        values (list[float]): Values for each time step in the original time series.
        target_time_steps (list[float]): Desired output time steps that needs to be added to the time series.

    Returns:
        list[float]: A list of values for the combined list of time steps and target_time_steps.
