Finite element based simulation tool for integrated circuits, electric and photonic!
The documentation is lagging behind the state of code,
so there's several features for which there are only examples in the code.

**You can try out the examples in the browser!**
**Hover the rocket at the top on the example pages and click live code!**
(Might take some time to load)

## Features

- Photonic eigenmode solver
- Periodic photonic eigenmode solver
- Electric eigenmode solver
- Thermal mode solver (static and transient)
- Coulomb solver

## Possible Simulations

- Eigenmodes of waveguides and determining their effective refractive index
- Coupling between neighboring waveguides
- Eigenmodes of bent waveguides
- Propagation loss of circular bends and mode mismatch loss with straight waveguides
- Calculation of the group velocity and its dispersion
- Calculation of overlap-integrals and confinement-factors
- Bragg grating cells
- Grating coupler cells
- Eigenmode of a coaxial cable and its specific impedance
- Eigenmodes of electric transmission lines
  and determining their propagation constant (in work)
- Static thermal profiles
- Transient thermal behavior
- Static electric fields
- Overlap integrals between waveguide modes
- Overlap integral between a waveguide mode and a fiber mode
- Coupled mode theory - coupling between adjacent waveguides
- Heat based photonic phase shifters
- Pockels based photonic phase shifters
- PN junction depletion modulator (analytical)
