    Generates all possible "weak" chains of pcsets that match the specified input criteria. The result is a list of
    posets of the form
    <pc_0 {...} pc_1 {...} pc_2 {...}>
    where a member of each set-class in the list appears in order. The unordered set is unioned with the immediately
    adjacent free pcs to form the actual set corresponding to the set-class in the list.
    This is a weaker form of the "strong" chains in Morris 1987, where there must be complete overlap between adjacent
    pcsets. In these chains, only one pc overlaps between adjacent pcsets.
    :param p0: The starting pitch
    :param sc_list: The list of set-class names
    :param max_2_similarity: The maximum adjacent similarity percentage (expressed as a decimal). Specifies
    the maximum percentage of a set that can be duplicated in an adjacent set. For example, 0.4 means that 2 out of 5
    pcs in a pentachord may be duplicated in each adjacent set. A value of 1 means that no similarity restrictions
    are imposed (since we are allowing up to 100% similarity). A value that is too low to allow at least 1 duplicate
    pc will prevent the algorithm from generating any chains at all (since we need at least one duplicate between
    each pair of adjacent pcsets).
    :param min_2_similarity: The corresponding minimum of max_2_similarity
    :param max_3_similarity: Like max_2_similarity, except this covers three adjacent pcsets. The default value is 1,
    which imposes no similarity restrictions.
    :param min_3_similarity: The corresponding minimum of max_3_similarity
    :param pn: The ending pitch (if left as None, no ending pitch will be separated out of the last sets)
    :return: A list of weak chains. The list will be empty if it was impossible to generate any chains matching the
    provided specifications.
