class InterpretCommand(commands.Command):

    Command classes can be registered to a unique keyword, then an interpreter will parse text
    loaded into it (the 'program') into those commands, passing any additional arguments to the 
    commands to alter their behaviour.

    Any class derived from Command should work fine, but a special interface called ModularCommand
    has been provided that allows for additional validation and parsing during compilation.

    Programs can be handled in 3 different ways: pure interpretation, JIT compilation, and pre-compilation.
    A purely interpreted program will be reinterpreted every time it is run. This is useful for programs that
    will only be run once or at most infrequently. JIT compiled programs will be compiled as executed, and the
    resulting commands will be cached for later use, which is useful for programs that will be run frequently, 
    especially longer ones. Pre-compiled programs are compiled before execution, and only the resulting commands
    are referenced during execution. This is most useful for short programs that need to run quickly. Longer 
    programs will incur a high initial cost, which will likely cause the robot to overrun its loop time. Of the
    3 approaches, JIT is the most generally recommended, and is the default. Compilation is 
    only recommended if you see a meaningful performance bottleneck with JIT. Interpretation is most recommended
    when the loaded program will change frequently, and any program will only be run once or twice.

    Please don't try to use this command in a command group. It will probably work, but will likely be prone to
    odd bugs. Whatever you're trying to accomplish can be done by registering the other commands in the group to 
    this command, then incorporating them into your program.
