# AutoMotif: Automated Motif Detection in Network Graphs
## What is it?
AutoMotif helps you find patterns, called motifs, in network graphs. It uses NetworkX for working with graphs, dotmotif for finding the patterns, and pandas for handling data. Whether your graphs are directed or not, AutoMotif can search for motifs based on the criteria you set, like motif size and whether to consider pattern repetitions (automorphisms).

## Installation

```bash
pip install automotifs
```
## Quick Start
```python
from automotifs import AutoMotif
import networkx as nx
# Example: A random directed graph
G = nx.gnp_random_graph(5, 0.5, directed=True)
# Set up AutoMotif
motif_finder = AutoMotif(Graph=G, size=3, directed=True, verbose=True)
# Start finding motifs
motifs = motif_finder.find_all_motifs()
```
## Features
- Automated Detection: Find motifs in your network without manually tweaking every parameter. AutoMotif takes care of the heavy lifting.
- Flexibility: Whether your networks are directed or undirected, AutoMotif can handle them. Plus, you can decide if you want to look for automorphisms and set the size of motifs to search for.
- Save for Later: Directly save your findings to CSV files, making it easier to analyze results or share them with others.

## Who made this? 
Giorgio Micaletto, under Professor Marta Zava's supervision at Bocconi University, put together AutoMotif. It was created to make network motif analysis less of a headache.
