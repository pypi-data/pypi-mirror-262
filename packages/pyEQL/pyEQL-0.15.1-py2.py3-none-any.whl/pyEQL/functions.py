    Returns:
        The change in Gibbs energy associated with complete mixing of the

    Notes:
        The Gibbs energy of mixing is calculated as follows

        Solutions, respectively.

        Note that dissociated ions must be counted as separate components,
        so a simple salt dissolved in water is a three component solution (cation,
        anion, and water).

def donnan_eql(solution: Solution, fixed_charge: str):
    r"""
    Return a solution object in equilibrium with fixed_charge.

    Args:
        solution : Solution object
            The external solution to be brought into equilibrium with the fixed
            charges
        fixed_charge : str quantity
            String representing the concentration of fixed charges, including sign.
            May be specified in mol/L or mol/kg units. e.g. '1 mol/kg'

    Returns:
        A Solution that has established Donnan equilibrium with the external
        (input) Solution

    Notes:
        The general equation representing the equilibrium between an external
        electrolyte solution and an ion-exchange medium containing fixed charges
        is

        .. math::

            \big(\frac{a_{-}}{\bar a_{-}} \big)^(\frac{1}{z_{-})
            \big(\frac{\bar a_{+}}{a_{+}}\big)^(\frac{1}{z_{+})
            \exp(\frac{\Delta \pi \bar V}{RT z_{+} \nu_{+}})

        Where subscripts :math:`+` and :math:`-` indicate the cation and anion, respectively,
        the overbar indicates the membrane phase,
        :math:`a` represents activity, :math:`z` represents charge, :math:`\nu` represents the stoichiometric
        coefficient, :math:`V` represents the partial molar volume of the salt, and
        :math:`\Delta \pi` is the difference in osmotic pressure between the membrane and the
        solution phase.

        In addition, electroneutrality must prevail within the membrane phase:

        .. math:: \bar C_{+} z_{+} + \bar X + \bar C_{-} z_{-} = 0

        Where :math:`C` represents concentration and :math:`X` is the fixed charge concentration
        in the membrane or ion exchange phase.

        This function solves these two equations simultaneously to arrive at the
        concentrations of the cation and anion in the membrane phase. It returns
        a solution equal to the input solution except that the concentrations of
        the predominant cation and anion have been adjusted according to this
        equilibrium.

        NOTE that this treatment is only capable of equilibrating a single salt.
        This salt is identified by the get_salt() method.
