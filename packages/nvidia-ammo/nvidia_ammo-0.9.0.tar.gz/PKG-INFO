AMMO
#########

*AlgorithMic Model Optimization.*

--------

AMMO is a library for conveniently optimizing and deploying efficient neural networks that can
fit a wide range of Nvidia hardware. It is intended for ML engineers to efficiently design, train,
and deploy their models on Nvidia from within their desired ML training framework, e.g., PyTorch.
