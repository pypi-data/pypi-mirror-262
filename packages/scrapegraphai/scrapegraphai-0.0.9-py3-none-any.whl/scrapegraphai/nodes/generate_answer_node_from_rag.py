class GenerateAnswerNodeFromRag(BaseNode):
    """
    A node that generates an answer using a language model (LLM) based on the user's input
    and the content extracted from a webpage. It constructs a prompt from the user's input
    and the scraped content, feeds it to the LLM, and parses the LLM's response to produce
    an answer.

    Attributes:
        llm (ChatOpenAI): An instance of a language model client, configured for generating answers.
        node_name (str): The unique identifier name for the node, defaulting 
        to "GenerateAnswerNode".
        node_type (str): The type of the node, set to "node" indicating a 
        standard operational node.

    Args:
        llm: An instance of the language model client (e.g., ChatOpenAI) used 
        for generating answers.
        node_name (str, optional): The unique identifier name for the node. 
        Defaults to "GenerateAnswerNode".

    Methods:
        execute(state): Processes the input and document from the state to generate an answer,
                        updating the state with the generated answer under the 'answer' key.
