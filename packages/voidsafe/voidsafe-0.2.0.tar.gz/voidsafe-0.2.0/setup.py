        `VoidSafe` is a package that brings a '_null-safe-like_' approach to Python3-written 
        scripts and applications. It provides software developers with resources to apply 
        `void-safety` principles to their codebase, allowing `safe` operations to be performed 
        on `Potentially Unsafe Instances [2.1]` , which helps assuring that your software will 
        be able to handle many `memory-access` problems at runtime.
