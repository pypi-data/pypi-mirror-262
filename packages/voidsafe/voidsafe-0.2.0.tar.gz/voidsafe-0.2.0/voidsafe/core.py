## VoidSafe
-----------
    \
`VoidSafe` is a library that brings a `void-safe`, `None-aware` approach to
Python3-written scripts and applications. It provides software developers with resources
to apply `null-safe`-like principles to their codebase, guaranteeing that safe
operations can be performed on `potentially unsafe instances [2.1]`, which helps assuring 
that your software will be able to handle many memory-access problems at runtime.  
    \
By being entirely `type-hinted`, this library works well when associated with most
`static type checkers`. When combined with a linter that's capable of predicting `unboud`
or `undefined` variables, this library helps the developer to identify problems with
their code even before running it.  
    \
The inspiration comes from the concept of `Null Safety`, which is adopted by several
programming languages, such as `Dart`, `Kotlin` and `C#`.

    \
`UNDEFINED` is a `Special Constant [1.3]` that's meant to represent an instance's  
resource that hasn't been defined before being accessed, which differs from an 
instance's `Optional` resource that has been defined as `None`.
    \
It is usually obtained from an attempt to getting resources from a `Potentially 
Unsafe Instance [2.1]` that is being checked by the `VoidSafe` `Special Agent [1.4]`.

- Example:

    ```python
    >>> from typing import Optional
    >>> from random import random
    >>> from voidsafe import VoidSafe, value
