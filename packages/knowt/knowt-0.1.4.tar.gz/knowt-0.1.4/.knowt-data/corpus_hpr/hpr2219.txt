## hpr2219 :: The Musings of a Novice Cable TV Cord Cutter

 I've included various websites of the items I discussed in the podcast.
One thing I didn't mention in my podcast is that to use Roku streaming applications you go to the Roku store via your Roku device or via a computer browser and set up a Roku account. Once you have an account you have downloading access to the apps. Most of these apps are free but most premium service require a monthly fee which can be paid through Roku or the streaming service.

For apps not in the official Roku Channel Store there is an unofficial Roku Private Channels store. These are applications for Roku devices similar to the Kodi/XBMC plug-ins:

I found a couple of apps in the Roku Private Channels store that can provide me access to ESPN if I wish to use them.
I don't condone piracy so use at your own risk:
