## hpr2183 :: Data Privacy: Farlands or bust

 Thanks to everyone for the emails and the opinion on the "Google It" episode.
I received a lot of emails and comments on my first episode. No one stated they disagreed with me on the opinion I was expressing but changed the conversation to be about their own privacy issues they have with Google's practices.
I wasn't dismissing those who feel Google overreaches in the privacy department. I was stating the fact that they are a very successful company DESPITE a lot of Tech writers and podcasters out here stating they aren't. You can argue the privacy points all you want but the fact is all I was stating was they are successful.
So with that said I weigh in on Privacy and how I see it. Disagree? let me know!
