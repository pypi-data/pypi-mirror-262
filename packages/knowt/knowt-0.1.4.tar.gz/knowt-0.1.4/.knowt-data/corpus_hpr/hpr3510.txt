## hpr3510 :: Syntax, Switches, and Help

 Since DOS is a command line type of operating system, it is really important that you understand the syntax of commands. The good news is that the system will do what you tell it to do. But the bad news is that it will do what you tell it to do. You have to tell it in the precisely correct way, and that means Syntax. And with a number of commands you can modify them using Switches. And where do you learn all about Syntax and Switches? Why, in the HELP system, of course!
