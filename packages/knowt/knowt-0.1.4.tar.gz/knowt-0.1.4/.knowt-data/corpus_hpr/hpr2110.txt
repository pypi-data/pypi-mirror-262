## hpr2110 :: Overhauling a Bicycle Hub

 I record and talk while overhauling the rear hub of my 1985 Schwinn road bike. I wasn’t able to take pictures because my hands were really greasy, so if this interests you and you want to see how it’s done, search the web or YouTube for instructional materials. This episode was recorded on my phone with the $2 lapel microphone, uploaded straight to the HPR website. Easy!
