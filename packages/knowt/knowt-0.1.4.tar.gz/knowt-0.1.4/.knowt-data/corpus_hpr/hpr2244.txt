## hpr2244 :: building lineageOS

 i am too ignorant to build for the device that i want.
i mention a dev from xda.
i am running debian sid... also mention arch and the importance of shownotes.
following lineage wiki, i merge the extra commands from a 14.1 device page.
install adb fastboot repo with package manager and you can ignore creating ~/bin, chmod command, and PATH update as these tools were installed by your package manager.
install list given on the wiki of packages...some will not exist... search to find out their names.
cd into the location for your project.
$ mkdir -p ./android/system
$ cd android/system
$ repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b cm-14.1
$ repo sync
$ repo sync
$ repo sync
successful new 50G on my drive.
$ nano android/system/.repo/local_manifests/roomservice.xml
add the needed lines from the muppets and ignore extracting proprietary blobs.
$ repo sync
$ source build/envsetup.sh
$ breakfast spyder
$ export USE_CCACHE=1
$ prebuilts/misc/linux-x86/ccache/ccache -M 50G
$ export ANDROID_JACK_VM_ARGS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+TieredCompilation -Xmx4G"
$ export WITH_SU=true
$ croot
$ brunch spyder
ran 99% and errored... xmllint command not found.
search for and install libxml2-utils.
rerun build and get an out of memory error... go to bed... try tomorrow... shutdown machine.
sift through old information as things have changed regarding file names and such.
$ nano ~/.jack-server/config.properties
change jack.server.max-service=4 to 2
start from envsetup.sh again.
$ cd $OUT
boot phone to recovery and install
$ adb sideload ./lineage-14.1-20170202-UNOFFICIAL-spyder.zip
i remove some apps and install fdroid.
