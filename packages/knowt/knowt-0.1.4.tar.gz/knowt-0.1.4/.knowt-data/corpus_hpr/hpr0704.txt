About Disaster Protocol 
The Disaster Protocol Podcast is an IT Security Podcast which aims to educate the listener about current news and stories regarding the IT security sector. Originally name S.H.I.T.cast (Student Hacker Information Technology podcast), it was aimed at a lower level of audience and was more about having fun then getting anything technical across.
There are two hosts to the podcast, Matthew Hughes and Thomas Mackenzie.
Matthew Hughes is an Ethical Hacking student at a British University and is the leader developer of SecurityBSD.co.uk. He is known on the podcast for his random facts and amazing shoot downs towards Tom.
Thomas Mackenzie is a student studying the same course at the same University as Matt. He is the co-developer of upsploit.com and works part-time from randomstorm.com.
