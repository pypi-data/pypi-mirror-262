 Inspirational stories told on the road
A few months ago I went on a longer trip, alone in my car. As many podcasters before me, I decided to record an episode. An episode I almost immediately forgot about. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, when I once again found the recording. It sounded quite bad, but after some sound wizardry I think it can pass for an HPR show. The content is where it's at, after all.
