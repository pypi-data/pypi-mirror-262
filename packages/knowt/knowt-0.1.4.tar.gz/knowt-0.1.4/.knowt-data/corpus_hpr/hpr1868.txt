## hpr1868 :: Glasgow Podcrawl review

 Glasgow Podcrawl review
The second Glasgow Podcrawl took place on the 10th of July 2015. The participants were:

Kevie
Andrew Conway (aka mcnalu)
Dave Morriss
Andrew Gregory

The event started at 6pm in the State Bar on Holland Street, moved on to the Bon Accord, the Inn Deep and finally to the Three Judges.
Dave Morriss departed after visiting the second bar to head back to Edinburgh, but everyone else lasted to the very end!
In this episode hear the details of this singular event, and a whole lot about many other things.
