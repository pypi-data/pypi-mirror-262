SndChaser thinks we are kind of spoiled with all the options - includnig things that don't exist elsewhere - like Awesome.  But lovest the ability we have to build our desktops to fit our workflows and optimize how we work.

(0020Z) K5Tux: Easy to learn (he's coming back to it...) -- "Going to change lanes: When discussing ease of use, what about "don't care to know" folks, gamers, etc -- those who don't worry about privacy and software freedom, I have my own thoughts on but I'd like to hear the consensus on the danger for those who just don't care."

Pokey mentions that he is furious that the authors guild forced the text-to-speech to be disabled on the Kindle... and names Roy Bloundt Jr.

Electronic versions of textbooks are not reducing the number of printed books.  Students have to buy / lease the paper books, then get the electronic version.  And, in many cases they cannot (easily) re-selly the paper copy for even half of what they paid.  In the case of grade school / highschool they cannot sell the books since they are just leased.

Pokey brought up OpenText Books: https://creativecommons.org/tag/open-textbooks
