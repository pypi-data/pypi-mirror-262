## hpr3429 :: Linux Inlaws S01E39: Ubuntu and the Community

 
    In this episode, our two hosts host Rhys Davies, a developer advocate from Canonical. So all
    beans will be spilled on one of the most popular Linux distros out there. Like its past, present
    and future. Never mind how Canonical makes its moolah and where this goes... Plus an interesting
    infomercial on old big iron (IBM, if you're listening: the mail address is sponsor@linuxinlaws.eu).
