## hpr1087 :: The FSCONS of Jonas Öberg 

 At the conference FSCONS I have a talk with both Henrik (who has no previous experience of FSCONS) and Jonas (who organise the conference). Two very different perspectives and a few completing comments from me.
Henrik
Henrik mentioned the two All In IT Radio episodes "Assembly Overclocked" where he told us of his experiences from the demo party Assembly and "Should Cars Get Smarter?" where we talk about Qt, In Vehicle Infotainment and such. The later show was featured as episode 0854 on Syndicated Thursday on Hacker Public Radio. We also referenced Jeremiah Foster, Johan Thelin and Mathias Klang
Jonas
When Jonas mentions "Henrik", he does not mean the Henrik of All In IT Radio fame, but rather Henrik Sandklef who sits on the board of "Föreningen fri kultur och programvara".
