What is PINN (PINN Is Not NOOBS)?
An easy enhanced Operating System installer for the Raspberry Pi
The latest version of PINN can be downloaded from sourceforge.
This README relates to v3.8
(PINN-lite does not include any operating systems at all.
It is more akin to NOOBS-lite rather than NOOBS. For that reason, the filename that you download is called pinn-lite.zip. More recently, pinn.zip has also been made available for download which includes versions of Raspbian and LibreELEC.)
