## hpr4033 :: Using playerctl to control media players

 About MPRIS

The Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification is a standard D-Bus
interface which aims to provide a common programmatic API for
controlling media players.


It provides a mechanism for discovery, querying and basic playback
control of compliant media players, as well as a tracklist interface
which is used to add context to the active media item.

man playerctl

DESCRIPTION
The playerctl utility controls MPRIS-enabled media players. In
addition to offering play, pause and stop control, playerctl also offers
previous and next track support, the ability to seek backwards and
forwards in a track, and volume control. playerctl also supports
displaying metadata (e.g., artist, title, album) for the current track,
and showing the status of the player.
Players that can be controlled using playerctl include audacious(1),
cmus(1), mopidy(1), mpd(1), quodlibet(1), rhythmbox(1), vlc(1) and
xmms2(1). However, any player that implements the MPRIS interface
specification can be controlled using playerctl including web
browsers.
