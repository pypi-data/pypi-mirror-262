## hpr3569 :: Linux Inlaws S01E53: Rust Marketing

 In this episode our two heroes explore the depths a new (?) hipster
programming language called Rust. Being an obvious piece of blatant technology
marketing, the Linux Inlaws are still waiting for the funds to arrive from the
Rust Foundation :-) (@Foundation: If you want to get in touch please send
a mail to sponsor at linuxinlaws eu). Jokes aside, the episode give a short
overview of this new programming language without going into deeper technical
details as this podcast is only the usual four hours long.
