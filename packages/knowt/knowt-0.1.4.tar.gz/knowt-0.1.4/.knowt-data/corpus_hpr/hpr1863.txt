## hpr1863 :: The Awesomely Epic Guide To KDE Part 2

 
Hello my name is Geddes and this is my second HPR Episode. Its part 2 of an audio voice recording of an article entitled THE AWESOMELY EPIC GUIDE TO KDE. This is a tutorial on the KDE Desktop,  which I did for Linux Voice Magazine back at the start of 2015. In this half the topics I cover are - Upgrade Launch Menu, File Management, Window Management, and Visual Effects.
