## hpr3492 :: Linux Inlaws S01E44: Pipewire Just another audio server Think again

 In this episode - sadly missing Martin as he buggered off to do something
else - the remaining Inlaw hosts Wim Taymans, inventor and brain behind
Pipewire, a new approach to Linux audio. Don't miss out on this episode if
you're fed up with Pulseaudio (hello Martin :-) or find Jack just too
complicated for every-day usage - you may see audio on Linux from a different
perspective after this episode... Never mind those of you who are looking for
a crash-course on audio on Linux - this episode is for you!
