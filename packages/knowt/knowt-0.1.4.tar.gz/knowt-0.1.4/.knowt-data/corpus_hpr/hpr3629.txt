## hpr3629 :: Linux Inlaws S01E59: The Show with Red Pandas Mosaic Killers and Metal Corrosion

 
In this episode, Martin and Chris interview Eric Rescorla, the CTO of Firefox at Mozilla. After
discussing the weather situation in the Kingdom formerly known as the UK, our two aging heros
go right into browsers, programming languages, the Mozilla ecosystem and internet history and future
alike. This episode again is not for the faint-hearted as none of the gory details are spared: We learn about Chris' t-shirt situation (and how you can kidnap apparel), why Google is so sucessful, data privacy and Internet monetization. Never mind rendering engines. Plus: more Rust marketing (Rebecca Rumbul: Take note :-).
