## hpr1451 :: Jeremy Allison ~ the SAMBA project

 HPR Coverage at FOSDEM 2014
The following are a series of interviews recorded at FOSDEM 2014.
FOSDEM is a free event that offers open source communities a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate.
For more information see the website https://fosdem.org/2014/, where you can watch a recording of the many talks https://video.fosdem.org/2014/
Jeremy Allison ~ the SAMBA projectFor some reason my Zoom H2 failed to record this interview. Based on past experience I'm more inclined to blame the operator than the device so the audio is taken from the backup recording device, a Sansa Clip. As we say at HPR, any recording is better than no recording so any strange audio artefacts are a result of that.
