## hpr2073 :: The power of GNU Readline - part 1

 The power of GNU Readline - part 1
We all use GNU Readline if we we use the CLI in Linux because it manages input, line editing and command history in Bash and in many tools.
I have been using Unix and later Linux since the 1980's, and gradually learnt how to do things like jump to the start or the end of the line, delete a character backwards up to a space, or delete the entire line.
I think that learning GNU Readline is worthwhile since it contains a lot more features than what I just described. I thought I would do a few episodes on HPR to introduce some of what I consider to be the most useful features.
I want to keep the episodes short since this is a dry subject, and, if you are anything like me, you can't take in more than a few key sequences at a time.
The source of my information is the GNU Readline Manual. This is very well written, if a little overwhelming.
