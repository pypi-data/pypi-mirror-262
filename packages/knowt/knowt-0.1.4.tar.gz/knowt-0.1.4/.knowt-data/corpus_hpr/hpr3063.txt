## hpr3063 :: Pens, pencils, paper and ink - 1

 Introduction
It’s been over four years since I did a show about fountain pens. It was in the What’s in My Toolkit series entitled What’s in my case, show 1941 released on 2016-01-11.
I thought it might be appropriate to visit the subject once again. I want to tell you about some new pens and pencils I have acquired, some inks I am enjoying and some of the notebooks I have bought.
There’s too much for a single show here, so I’m making a mini-series of three shows. This also leaves the door open for more when the collection grows in the future!
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes with pictures for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
