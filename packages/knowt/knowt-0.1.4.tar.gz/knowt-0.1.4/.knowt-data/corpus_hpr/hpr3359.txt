## hpr3359 :: Linux Inlaws S01E32: Politicians and artificial intelligence part 3

 In part three of the 27.64 episodes long mini-series on artificial intelligences, machine and deep learning
and other hipster topics around machines trying to imitate humans (marketing made us do these :-), our
two heroes discuss domain-specific frameworks on top of (more generic) infrastructure like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
As usual, all will be revealed and no details be spared (apart from a very few) including how to
tell animals apart from humans (a tricky feat as any journalist can tell you who's ever faced a
stampeding horde of angry politicians!).
