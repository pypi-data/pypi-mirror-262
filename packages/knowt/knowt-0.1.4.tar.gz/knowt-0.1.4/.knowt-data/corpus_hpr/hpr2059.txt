## hpr2059 :: More Tech, Less Magic

 This was my first show for HPR! I wanted to offer up something unique–hopefully not too much so to enjoy.
In this episode I talk a bit about the differences between how my son will grow up with gaming technology, and how I did. There’s a lot of nostalgia, a little humor, and also a bit of language.
All in-show music was created by me.
