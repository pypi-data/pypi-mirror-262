## hpr3467 :: Protonmail in the terminal

 I use email in the terminal with a combination of:

protonmail-bridge-cli
local IMAP server to fetch Protonmail mails

tmux
to run protonmail-bridge in

isync (or offlineimap etc)
to sync IMAP with maildirs

notmuch
to tag and search mails

afew
to move mails found by certain notmuch queries in certain maildirs

alot
to read, compose, search and tag mails

msmtp
to send mails

w3m (or lynx etc)
to read HTML mails in the terminal

rsync
to copy archived mails

a shell function and an alias
to make it all less ridiculous


To most, Thunderbird will be suitable, the target audience here is unreasonable people.
