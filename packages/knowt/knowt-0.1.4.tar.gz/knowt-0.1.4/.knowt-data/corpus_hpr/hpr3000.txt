## hpr3000 :: Chopin Free project

 
The Musopen (www.musopen.org) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit focused on improving access and exposure to music by creating free resources and educational materials. We provide recordings, sheet music, and textbooks to the public for free, without copyright restrictions. Put simply, our mission is to set music free.


Their latest Kickstarter aims to open the works of Frédéric Chopin copyright free.
