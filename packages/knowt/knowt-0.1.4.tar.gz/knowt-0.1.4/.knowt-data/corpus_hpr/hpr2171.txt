## hpr2171 :: hello world

 I love programming, I make a living writing free software. However I am still a programmer without a keyboard. I want to share knowledge that gives us control over our own life. Tools that help us help ourselves.
Two main topics:

computers (of course!)

everyday user
free software
programming

AFK stuff

veganism,
minimalism,
botany,
engineering.


Lots of fun, life is interesting
happy hacking
