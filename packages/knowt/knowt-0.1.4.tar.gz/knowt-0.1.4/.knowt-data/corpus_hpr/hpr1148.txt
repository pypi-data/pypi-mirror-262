## hpr1148 :: Development Discussion

 
I am trying to write a script which will implement the scheduling rules for
HPR. I spoke to Ken Fallon about this, and where it would fit in the overall
design of the HPR system, when we met up at OggCamp 2012 in August, but we
didn't manage to resolve very much. So, recently Ken and I began a discussion
over Mumble to try and make progress. A few minutes in we decided to record
our discussion for posterity, and this is the result.


The notes which I had sent Ken before our Mumble session are available in PDF
format.
