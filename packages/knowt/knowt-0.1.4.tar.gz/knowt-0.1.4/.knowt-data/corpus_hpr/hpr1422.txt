## hpr1422 :: Setting up and using SSH and SOCKS

 
In this episode I go through how I set up SSH and SOCKS.  This is very useful when you need to feel a bit more secure in your internet traffic and need to keep out of prying eyes.  I also go over some tools used to access your home network from a Windows computer.
