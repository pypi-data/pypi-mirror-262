## hpr3173 :: Manage your Raspberry Pi fleet with Ansible

 
This is the final show in the miniseries on how to manage your RaspberryPis with ansible. The goal is to produce a common base Raspberry Pi OS image that doesn't change often but, once it's installed, can automatically be customized, maintained, and managed remotely.


We will create the base image using the script fix-ssh-on-pi which is available on GitHub. 


Then we will identify the hosts on the network with tips from operat0r in show hpr3090 :: Locating Computers on a Enterprise Network, or for simpler networks from my own show hpr3052 :: Locating computers on a network.


Finally we will provision the devices using tips from hpr3080 :: Ansible ping, and hpr3162 :: Introduction to Ansible 


This show has been been simultaneously published as an article on opensource.com.
