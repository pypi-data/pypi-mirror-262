## hpr1449 :: Timelapse Video

 
A quick introduction to timelapse video and some of the tools used in linux to help create them. 


cd to dir that holds the images


Create a directory called resize and run


 "mogrify -path resize -resize 1920x1080! *.JPG" 


If you need to Deflicker your images place the script in your resize directory 
and run


 "./timelapse-deflicker.pl -v"


This will create a dir called deflickered


If you use mencoder to create your video you need to use ls and make a text 
file with the files listed in sequential order


 "ls -1tr | grep -v files.txt > files.txt"


then


 "mencoder -nosound -noskip -oac copy -ovc copy -o outputfile.avi -mf fps=25 'mf://@files.txt'


if you use ffmpeg something like this should get you out of trouble, though 
your files need to be named in sequential order starting with img(number 1 2 etc).jpg 


 "ffmpeg -f image2 -i img%d.jpg -vcodec libx264 outputfile.mp4"
