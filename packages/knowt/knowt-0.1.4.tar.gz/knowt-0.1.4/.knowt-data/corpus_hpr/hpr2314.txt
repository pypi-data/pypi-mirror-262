## hpr2314 :: Bad Caps

 
NYbill talks about repairing a motherboard.
Errata:
Even though I go into a bit about different types of capacitors I didn't plan on this being an episode about capacitors themselves. Even though I mention some different types. Bonus, there are also Trimmer Caps.
And yes, I know LCD's don't have a trace. The old school CRT user popped out there. You all knew what I meant.
Also, I know I mentioned getting a 90 piece cap set from Banggood. I decided to order proper Nichicon replacements from Digikey. Had this been a repair for myself, I would use the no name caps I ordered from China. But, being this repair is for a friend, I figured I better get the real deal. ...BTW they were 220 uf caps.
(Thanks Jezra for the musical interlude. We were joking calling it, "Time Passing".)
