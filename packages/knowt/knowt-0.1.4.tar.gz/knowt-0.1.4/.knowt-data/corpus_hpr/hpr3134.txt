## hpr3134 :: Tomorrowland 2020

 The music festival Tomorrowland was made virtual this year.
Usually, they have 200k visitors over two weekends on a small area of 128 football (soccer) fields. This year they digitally did it all, which was engaging and fun. I've never attended, but I loved this year, where I could be a part of the experience.
This recording was made at 01.00 AM right after the festival had ended, so I still had the hype, totally sober but euphoric.
