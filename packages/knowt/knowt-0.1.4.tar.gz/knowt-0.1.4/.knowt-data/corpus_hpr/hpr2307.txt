I couldn't find a link to the supposed problem with the headphone socket on the Baofeng UV5R and despite regularly plugging and unplugging the covert earpiece so far mine seems to be working OK as long as I don't push the plug too far in. Perhaps on this radio it is less of a problem than I first thought.
