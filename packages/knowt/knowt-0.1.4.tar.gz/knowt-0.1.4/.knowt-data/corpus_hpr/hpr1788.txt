## hpr1788 :: Podcrawl Glasgow 2015

 
Dave Morriss and Kevie have a yarn about the upcoming Glasgow Podcrawl.  The event takes place on the 10th of July 2015 and kicks off at 6pm in the State Bar, Holland Street.  The event is open to anybody with an interest in open source software or creative commons music.  Whether you're an enthusiast or just interest in finding out more, also if you're a member of a band then we would love to have you along for a yarn over a few pints.
