## hpr2403 :: Amateur Radio Round Table #3

 This is the 3rd in the Amateur Radio Round Table series.
Participants in this episode are:

Steve, KD0IJP
Michael, DL4MGM
Ken, N0CALL
Russ, K5TUX

No agenda items had been set before recording, so we spent our time answering Ken's questions and allowing the discussion to proceed naturally. Some of the topics of conversation included:

What the licensing exams are like in the US as well as Germany.
Resonance.
Antenna design.
RF Modulation

The next Amateur Radio Round Table recording is tentatively set for November 15, 2017 at 18:00 UTC. Watch the HPR email list for any further updates on this and consider joining in the discussion if you are a "ham" or if you aren't but have any interest in the subject.
