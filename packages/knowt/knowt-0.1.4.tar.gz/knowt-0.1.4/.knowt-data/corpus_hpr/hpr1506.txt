During this show the hosts also discuss beverages.
Colin was drinking a Badger Brewery Golden Glory, and quite enyoyed it. https://www.hall-woodhouse.co.uk/beer/golden-glory 
pokey drank a Fosters Lager, and he didn't like it very much. Thankfully he only wanted it for the can. Sadly, it really seemed to go straight to his head. https://www.fostersbeer.com/ 
According to Fosters' website, "You need to upgrade your Flash Player." Good luck with that.


Our next audiobook will be The Crown Conspiracy by Michael J. Sullivan
https://podiobooks.com/title/the-crown-conspiracy/
This book was suggested by pokey. pokey likes The Crown Conspiracy very much and has found it appropriate to suggest to both his mother and his daughter.


You can find more content (including podcasts) from Nathan Lowell https://nathanlowell.com/
We discussed looking up interviews with Nathan Lowell, and as it turns out he has links to lots of them on his website https://nathanlowell.com/multimedia/interviews-articles/ If you're a Nathan Lowell fan, you've got many hours of enjoyment ahead of you.  


Colin welcomes your feedback via email to gigasphere"nineteeneighty" at gee mail dot com
pokey prefers his feedback to come via the hacker public radio comment system.
