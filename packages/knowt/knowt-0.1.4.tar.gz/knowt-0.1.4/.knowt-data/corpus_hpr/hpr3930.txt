## hpr3930 :: Playing Civilization II Test of Time

 For reasons I go into, this is in some respects a different game from
Civilization II, at least different enough to deserve some separate
attention. The multiple map feature makes for some interesting game play
possibilities that add interest to this version, and the fact that it
has no defined end point is also intriguing. And the scenarios add some
interesting story differences as well.
