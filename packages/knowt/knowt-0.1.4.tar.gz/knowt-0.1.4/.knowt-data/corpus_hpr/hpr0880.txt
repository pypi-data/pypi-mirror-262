## hpr0880 :: Handbook for the Criminally Insane

 
In this episode of the HPR audio book club Broam, resno, Dann Washko, Integgroll, and pokey discuss the podiobooks.com presentation of Handbook for the Criminally Insane written and read by Brian Holtz. This episode contains spoilers, in the second half, so please listen to the audiobook for yourself before listening to the podcast all the way through. This book was met with polarizingly mixed reviews. Some thought it was a light hearted horror comedy in the spirit of Bruce Campbell while others thought it was something less entertaining.
