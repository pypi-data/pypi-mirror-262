## hpr2315 :: Penguicon 2017 Report

 Penguicon 2017 is a combined technology and science fiction convention in Southfield, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, and presents over 500 hours of programming over the entire weekend. Of this, around 100 hours are open source, tech-related. In this episode I tell you about my own personal experience at Penguicon this year.
