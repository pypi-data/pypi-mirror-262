A disc with a 25GB capacity is the equivalent of 23.28 gigabytes
Normally rated at 50GB, in practice they can record about 46.57GB of
data

Generate ISO image from directory
genisoimage -U -R -allow-lowercase -allow-multidot -o mydvd.iso "$1"
Alternative is mkisofs
-U

Allows "untranslated" filenames, completely violating the ISO9660 standards described above. Enables the following flags: -d -l -N -allow-leading-dots -relaxed-filenames -allow-lowercase -allow-multidot -no-iso-translate. Allows more than one `.' character in the filename, as well as mixed-case filenames. This is useful on HP-UX, where the built-in cdfs filesystem does not recognize any extensions. Use with extreme caution.

-R

Generate SUSP and RR records using the Rock Ridge protocol to further describe the files on the ISO9660 filesystem.

Corrected command
genisoimage -R -o mydvd.iso "$1"
Burning data to a DVD or Blu-ray
Note:
Make sure that the medium is not mounted when you begin to write to
it. Mounting may happen automatically if the medium contains a readable
file system. In the best case, it will prevent the burn programs from
using the burner device. In the worst case, there will be misburns
because read operations disturbed the drive. So if in doubt, do:
umount /dev/sr0
growisofs has a small bug with blank BD-R media. It issues an error
message after the burning is complete. Programs like k3b then believe
the whole burn run failed. To prevent this, either format the blank BD-R
by dvd+rw-format /dev/sr0 before submitting it to growisofs or use
growisofs option
