## hpr2440 :: How to save bad beans or the French press

 Memorial

We take some time to remember our good friend and fellow host Lord Drachenblut who passed away one year ago yesterday. 
Now may be a good time to re listen to hpr2201 :: Matthew "Lord Drachenblut" Williams HPR Community members remember the digital dragon.

Shownotes
I was driving in a place where I had no signal, so I recorded an episode about the first thing that popped into my mind.
Recorded with lineageos recorder app through monster isport bluetooth headphones. I'm amazed at the sound quality. I'll do this more. I promise
(no I won't, I'm lazy)
