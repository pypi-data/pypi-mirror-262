## hpr0861 :: Emacs Part 3: The Reckoning.

 
A small mini series (three parts) on GNU Emacs; Klaatu tells you how to use it, when to use it and when not to, why you'd want to use it, and most of all - how to become a pro on it! Not a sales pitch for Emacs, just a harmless introduction. First try is free.
