For callers, there will be a seperate room to test your setup before jumping in the live room just to avoid doing on air mic checks. Please check your sound there before jumping into the main room. Please set compression to the 31.8Kb/s speex codec for compatibility (NOT the CELT codec), and use push to talk.
Stream Address: Mirrors to be announced. We have at least one high bandwidth offer so far.
