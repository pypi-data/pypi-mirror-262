 Klaatu talks about setting up your Nokia N8*0 or N770 to be a robust computing platform, and the importance of doing so before you need it rather than waiting, like he does, until the last minute and scrambling to get all the packages you need installed.  He concedes that he's failed to mention a lot of cool apps, so feel free to make suggestions in the comments.
