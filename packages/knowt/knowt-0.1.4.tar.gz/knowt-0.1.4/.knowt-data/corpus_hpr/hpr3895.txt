## hpr3895 :: What's in my backpack

 I have many things in my work backpack, to include a Raspberry Pico,
multiple USB drives, USB cables, two laptops, my glasses and a
sunglasses case attached to the outside.
It is a 5.11 RUSH MOAB 10 Sling Pack 18L, not because I want to be
"tacticool" but because I like their products, and that they support
veterans like myself.
