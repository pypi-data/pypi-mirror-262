## hpr1164 :: About git

 
In this show I talk about the git version control system. I won't give
example commands, but I discuss concepts like commits, branches,
merging, push and pull, and rebasing. I also talk about the git workflow
I use.


I will put some more info on https://johanv.org/node/200.
