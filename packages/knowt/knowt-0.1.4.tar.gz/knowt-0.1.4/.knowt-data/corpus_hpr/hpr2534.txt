## hpr2534 :: Moving to Office 365 (and painting the ceiling)

 A couple of weeks ago we moved to a new house and I had some time on my hands to talk to you guys while painting the ceiling. Moving was very much on the forefront of my mind since I also recently moved my company's Email platform to Office 365. As a cross platform slider with a foot in each major operating system I decided to give you my first impressions of the new platform (and upset the GNU-purists) with my review.
