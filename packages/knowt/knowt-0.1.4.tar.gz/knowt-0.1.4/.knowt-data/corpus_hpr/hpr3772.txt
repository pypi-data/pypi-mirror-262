## hpr3772 :: Adventures with a small solar panel

 Solar panels are not like other sources of electricity that we are
used to using, such as the mains or batteries. In this episode I recount
what I have learned from playing with a small few-watt solar panel and
how to coax useful electricity out of it. Some multimeters were harmed
in the making of this episode.
