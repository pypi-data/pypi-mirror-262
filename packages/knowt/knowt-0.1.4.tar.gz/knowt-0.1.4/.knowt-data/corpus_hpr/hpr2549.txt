## hpr2549 :: DVD ripping using old hardware

 
Had a tower with a bad motherboard.
Wife found one at the Savers (Goodwill) for $8
Board worked, but had no video
Bought a 8mb video card for $10
Power supply fan seized, $10,

Got a warning about danger of opening up a power supply.

Distro should be on a USB key, and run headless

Easy way to back up the system

Had Arch installed, no 32 bit support after end of 2017
Installed Slackware, only working distribution for my hardware

Found it useful to have a script to chroot from the install media to the Slackware install.
Added a boot delay to mkinitrc for usb, otherwise it would boot with a message about not finding /mnt in /etc/fstab

Set up ssh with alternative port
Installed mplayer and tmux, and ripit with sbopkg

Mplayer to rip streams for movies and shows
Tmux is my favorite for resuming from a different PC or mobile

Needed a way to rip any media regardless of encryption

Only need libdvdcss to read
Includes Disney (Star Wars, Tron)

CD ripping was a bonus

Ripit to rip CDs

Scripts are on Github

Happy ripping!
