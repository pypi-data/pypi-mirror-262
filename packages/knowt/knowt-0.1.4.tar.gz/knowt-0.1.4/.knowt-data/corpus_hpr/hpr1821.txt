## hpr1821 :: James Beard's Never-Fail Blender Hollandaise Sauce

 
Frank describes James Beard's simple and almost infallible recipe for making Hollandaise sauce with a blender.

The recipe from the _Theory_and_Practice_of_Good_Cooking_, used copies of which can be readily found via a web search.  According to Amazon.doc, new copies are also available.  Frank's copy is a first edition dating from 1977, though it's been used too much to be a collector's item.
