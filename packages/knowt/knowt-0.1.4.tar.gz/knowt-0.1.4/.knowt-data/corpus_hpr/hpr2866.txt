## hpr2866 :: Intro to Bitcoin for techies

 This is a broad introduction to Bitcoin from a technical perspective. We do not talk about finance or economics, and we don’t compare distributed ledger technologies. We’re not addressing exchanges, layer 2 technologies, mainstream adoption, etc.
We’re also going to avoid going deep into forks, fungibility, mining or the math of Bitcoin.
In this episode we introduce these fundamental Bitcoin topics:

What is Bitcoin?
Blockchains and blocks
What are transactions?
What are miners and what do they do?
Proof of Work in Bitcoin - SHA256 hashing
Bitcoin consensus mechanism
How do wallets work?
Brief discussion about various types of wallets and wallet security

I hope this is accessible and informative and look forward to doing more in the future.
