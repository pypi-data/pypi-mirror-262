## hpr2706 :: Why I love the IBM AS/400 computer systems

 This is a talk about my love for the IBM family of AS/400 computer systems.
Although it’s a very hacker unfriendly system there is still much to admire and love.
It’s completely different from anything else which makes it nice but also very likely to disappear in few years from now. To prevent that piece of computing history to vanish I started a small initiative called https://www.as400museum.org/. It’s just me, but it does show my intention with the system.
