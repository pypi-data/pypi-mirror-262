## hpr1603 :: GUADEC 2014: Matthew Garrett Interview

 This year's GUADEC, the Gnome Users and Developers Conference was held in Strasbourg, France. Keynote Speaker was free software activist Matthew Garrett. He held an inspiring speech on the Linux and Gnome desktop and laid out his vision for both. Afterwards, I was able to ask him a few questions.
