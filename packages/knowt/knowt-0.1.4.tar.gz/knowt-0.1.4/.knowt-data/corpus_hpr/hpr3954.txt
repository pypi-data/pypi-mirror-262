## hpr3954 :: Sedating HPR at the Steading

 
Introduction
Hosts:

MrX
Dave
Morriss

We recorded this on Sunday September 3rd 2023. We met in
person again, and as before first visited the pub called The
Steading where we had lunch. Then we adjourned to Dave's car in the
car park, and recorded a chat.
The name "Steading" is another (Scots?) version of "Farmstead", and
means the same. It's also an anagram of "Sedating"1, so

Topics discussed

Vaccines:

Dave has an appointment for COVID-19 and
influenza vaccines. The new Omicron
variant BA.2.86 has prompted another booster for some people.

Subway



Edinburgh:

Dave took a trip on the recently extended Edinburgh tram

There is only one route, from the airport to Leith (port).
Older residents get free access.

MrX and MrsX recently walked from the centre of Edinburgh along the
Water of Leith to the
area where the tram terminus is at Newhaven.



Email:

Dave is using version Thunderbird 115.1.1 which
is a rewrite of the original series where the API has now changed a
lot.
Long-used add-ons now no longer work:

A favourite was Mailbox Alert which triggered sound alerts
(or others) then mail arrived in a folder - so this could be after
filtering. This was much more useful than the traditional "You have
mail" type alerts.

Discussion of tags:

MrX mentions tags, meaning bits of text that can be attached to
messages and used to classify them and to search for them.
In Gmail there are labels which can do this and these can
be used to group messages regardless of folders
Thunderbird also has this concept which it calls tags. It
comes with pre-defined tags such as Important and
To Do, but more tags can be added. Any message can be
given one or more tags. The filtering system can add tags as a message
is processed. Searches can be performed on tags also.
Dave is an enthusiast of nested folders with filters to classify
messages. MrX is keen on using tags for the same purpose. Dave mentioned
Thunderbird's saved search feature (which he wrongly called
virtual mailboxes) which can collect messages according to many
criteria, including tags.
Some discussion about mail message storage strategies: file per
message, mbox format, etc.




Ticks:

MrX's dog has brought some ticks back from recent walks.
Scotland seems to be a bit worse off for ticks in recent years.
Hikers need to protect against them and to perform checks that they
are not on clothes. Wearing long socks or gaiters over long trousers can
help.
Lyme
Disease is a bacterial infection that can be passed by ticks.
This Week in Parasitism
recently talked about an unpleasant disease caught from ticks, Babesiosis
(not bacterial as Dave thought, but caused by a protozoan). This was in
the USA; the disease doesn't seem to be in the UK at the moment.
Removal
of ticks needs a tool or a fine pair of tweezers.



Audacity:

Ahuka
did a recent show (hpr3927 ::
Audacity Update 20230702) on some problems he'd encountered.

Edinburgh Festival and Festival Fringe:

MrX attended a show by Michael Shafar, the comedian
Dave hasn't been to much at the Festival/Fringe in recent years. He
saw the Doug Anthony
All Stars when they were active many years ago, and found them funny
but intimidating!
