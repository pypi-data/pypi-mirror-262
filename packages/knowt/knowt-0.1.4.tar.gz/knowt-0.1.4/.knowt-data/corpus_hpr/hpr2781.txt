Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2019-March/thread.html
Any other business
Mint Cast

Did we mention the The Mint Cast ?

Sorry Yannick!
There was a misunderstanding about Yannick’s show 2740 when it was discussed on the February Community News. The show was about Pop_OS!, a subject Yannick had also spoken about previously on an edition of the TuxJam podcast.
The misunderstanding was that we thought this might have gone against guidelines on syndication, where in fact it did not. It was merely a case of the same subject being spoken about by the same person on two different podcasts.
Change to the host page
The page for each host:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/correspondents/NNNN.html
which used to contain a list of all shows contributed by that host, with the show notes, has been made more compact. It now displays only the title, release date, duration, series (if applicable), tags and the show summary. Clicking on the title takes you to the show itself. Note that the host id number NNNN must be 4 digits with leading zeroes.
The list of all hosts in alphabetic order can be seen at https://hackerpublicradio.org/correspondents/index.html (navigate with the top menu bar: Home→About→Hosts). From there clicking on the host number takes you to the page for that host. There’s also a link to the host page from the page for each show.
Community News Calendar
An iCal calendar has been prepared which holds the next 12 recording dates for the Community News. This calendar can be downloaded and opened by suitable clients such as the Thunderbird mail client or Google Calendar. The file is linked from https://hackerpublicradio.org/about.php and may be downloaded from https://www.hackerpublicradio.org/HPR_Community_News_schedule.ics.
Tags and Summaries
Thanks to the following contributors for sending in updates in the past month: Ken Fallon, NYbill, windigo
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 32 shows which were without them.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
