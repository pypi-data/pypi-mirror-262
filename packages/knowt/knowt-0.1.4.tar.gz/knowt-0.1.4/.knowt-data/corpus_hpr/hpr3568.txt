## hpr3568 :: PopKorn Episode 2: Programming, Mathematics, and Asymmetric Literacy

 Talking Points

Any audio is better than no audio?
Mathematics = Logic
ZFC Axioms show logical structure
Peano Axioms illustrating this point
Euclid's Axioms showing how just because something is logical doesn't mean that has anything to do with reality
x86 Instruction set showing the axiomatic basis of programming
Asymmetric Literacy in Chinese languages.
NOTE: This section is slightly incorrect in that there is a separate written form for Cantonese as well, but I hope that the main idea is still intelligible.
