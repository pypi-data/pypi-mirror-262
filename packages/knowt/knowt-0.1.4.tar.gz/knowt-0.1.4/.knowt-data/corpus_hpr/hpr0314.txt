## hpr0314 :: LVM2

 Kevin gives a brief and basic overview of Logical Volume
Management, or LVM.

Please note that I will be using a Debian GNU+Linux frame of
reference, and that there is a possibility that some of the
command-line details of some of he commands may differ to some extent.

Also note that the current LVM package is "LVM2", and that when I use
the term LVM, that I am, indeed, referring to LVM2.
