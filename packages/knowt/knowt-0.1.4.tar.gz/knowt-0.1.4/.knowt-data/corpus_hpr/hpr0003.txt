## hpr0003 :: Lost Haycon Audio

 
It's 12:10AM on the 10th of November 2007 and Morgellon, droops and phyboy are at Haycon, one of the first Unconferences. The conversations turns to Geocaching, and so armed with laptop, flash light (and possibly beer) our intrepid explorers head off to do a night time run. Here the way is marked by reflectors that are difficult to see in day time.

Along the way we hear crickets, tales of wolves, forgotten roads, civil war destruction, abandoned cemeteries and how karma came to one real estate developer.
