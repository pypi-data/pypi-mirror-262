## hpr2907 :: Stardrifter RPG Playtest Part 05

 
This episode is Part 5 of the Stardrifter role-playing game playtest. The series is composed of two playtest sessions, held earlier this year. They were recorded and chopped into manageable bites, then edited down into separate episodes.


This series is meant to give listeners some insight into the RPG construction process. Playtesting is not the final step, but rather, just another stage. The construction of an RPG can be convoluted, and feedback from players is absolutely vital.


In this part, the characters take on a contract to deal with some...hippies?


Special thanks to my playtesters: Klaatu, Thaj, and Mark (who was playing Brinn)
