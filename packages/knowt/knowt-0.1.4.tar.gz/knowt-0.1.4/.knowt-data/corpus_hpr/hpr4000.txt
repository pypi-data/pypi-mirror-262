## hpr4000 :: New Orleans

 We get to visit New Orleans, and a bit of Louisiana, in this episode.
Of course, we only scratched the surface, but that is true of most
travel when you think about it. We did see a few interesting things
along the way, and started to realize that this trip is not just about
NASA sites, but also a lot of military history, which is also an
interest of mine.
