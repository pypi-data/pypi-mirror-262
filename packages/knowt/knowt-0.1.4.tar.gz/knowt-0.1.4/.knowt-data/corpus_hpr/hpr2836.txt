## hpr2836 :: Interview with Wendy Hill

 Wendy Hill is a photographer. And by that, I don’t mean she takes pictures of her kids on Sundays at the baseball game. Although, if she was to do that, it would probably turn out to be great pictures. No, Wendy is a professional photographer, and to run her business, she uses free and opensource software.
Wait… no Photoshop? No Illustrator? How is that possible? Wendy joined me on Mumble earlier this year – that’s 2019 for you, visitors from the future – and we discussed about that.
