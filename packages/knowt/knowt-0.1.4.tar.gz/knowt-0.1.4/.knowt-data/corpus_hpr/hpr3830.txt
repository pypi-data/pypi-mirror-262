## hpr3830 :: Into New Mexico

 We made a change in our itinerary and instead of going up into the
mountains of New Mexico we went down to the area of the border of
Mexico. Our first stop was in Deming, NM for a few days, the on to
Anthony, NM for a longer stay of nearly three weeks. Anthony is located
between Las Cruces, NM, and El Paso, Texas, so it was a convenient
location for visiting both of the places, and we did so. In hindsight,
we liked Las Cruces and the New Mexico part a lot better than El
Paso.
