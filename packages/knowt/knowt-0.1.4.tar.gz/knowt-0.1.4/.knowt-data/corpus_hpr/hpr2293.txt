Pathname expansion; part 2 of 2
Expansion
As we saw in the last episode 2278 (and others in this sub-series) there are eight types of expansion applied to the command line in the following order:

Brace expansion (we looked at this subject in episode 1884)
Tilde expansion (seen in episode 1903)
Parameter and variable expansion (this was covered in episode 1648)
Command substitution (seen in episode 1903)
Arithmetic expansion (seen in episode 1951)
Process substitution (seen in episode 2045)
Word splitting (seen in episode 2045)
Pathname expansion (the previous episode 2278 and this one)

This is the last topic in the (sub-) series about expansion in Bash.
In this episode we will look at extended pattern matching as also defined in the “Manual Page Extracts” section at the end of the long notes.
Long Show Notes
I have written out a moderately long set of notes about this subject and these are available here.
