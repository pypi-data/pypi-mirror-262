 Linux / Floss Podcasts

Dudmonovi: Wish it was still going.  I really like Dude Man's ideas.  (https://feeds.feedburner.com/DudmanoviBlogAboutEverything)

Floss Weekly: I skip some of these because they do not apply to something I would use. (https://leo.am/podcasts/floss/)

GNU World Order: Klaatu is pretty similar to me.  (https://gnuworldorder.info/ogg.xml)

HPR: Obviously (https://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_rss.php)

Kernal Panic Oggcast: Good general news. (https://kernelpanicoggcast.net/rss.php)

Linux Lug Cast: Frequently on the show (https://feeds.feedburner.com/linuxlugcast/JZUx)

Open Source Musicians Podcast: Although I don't do much with audio production these days I still enjoy listening to it and hoping that one day I'll have time to get back into it. (https://opensourcemusician.libsyn.com/rss)

Linux Action Show and Linux Unplugged: I've been suprised with the quality of Jupiter Broadcasting shows recently.  I had dropped this show for a long time but I have recently begun listening to it again. (https://feeds.feedburner.com/computeractionshowvideo) (https://feeds.feedburner.com/linuxunogg)

Linux Outlaws: May it rest in peace.  This is the podcast that got me started in Linux.  Without it I would still be using Macs....shudder. (https://feeds.feedburner.com/linuxoutlaws)


Pop Culture General Podcasts

Podculture: Local folks who talk about nerdy things.  (https://www.podculture.com/feed/)

The Mindrobbers: This show is run by a writer from my gernal area named Scott Carelli.  I orginially heard of him through Podculture.  I've followed his various podcasts for many years and this is the most recent incarnation.  Although sometimes I don't always agree with his opinions I do always look forward to hearing them. (https://www.mindrobber.net/feed/)

Trekcast: My first undying love in this world is Star Trek.  (https://trekcast.podbean.com/feed/)

The Doctor's Companion: Another podcast by Scott Carelli and gang.  Good American centreic view of Doctor Who, another of my favorite shows. (https://www.thedoctorscompanion.us/?feed=rss2)

The Babylon Podcast: This show isn;t in production anymore, but if you are a fan of Babylon 5 (which I am) this is a great show that breaks down each episode, and interviews many of the stars from the show. (https://www.babylonpodcast.com/category/shows/feed/)

Fear the Boot: A great tabletop role playing game podcast (https://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/?feed=rss2)

Hiyaa Martial Arts Podcast: Must listening for martial artists (especially of the chinese martial arts persuasion).  There are very few good martial arts podcasts out there that are not style specific.  This fits the bill.  One of the host practices the same style of kung fu that I do (although through a different branch of the family tree) and it's nice to see that perspective on other arts.

This American Life: NPR.. used to be an addict. (https://feeds.thisamericanlife.org/talpodcast)

Unfilter: Jupiter Broadcasting's version of No Agenda.  I used to listen to No Agenda but I find that it has become too long, and they tend to go off the deep end on some of their annalysis in my opinion.  I find Unfilter to be a little more grounded, and it's an hour and a half once a week.  I'll still listen to No agenda from time to time, but not regularly since I found this.

Ham Radio Podcasts

Linux in the Ham Shack: K5TUX and crew talk about the inersection of Ham and Linux.  (https://lhspodcast.info/category/podcast-mp3/feed/)

Resonant Frequency: another Ham radio podcast from an alum of Linux in the Ham Shack (https://rfpodcast.info/Podcast/feed/)

Ham Nation: Twit's Ham radio podcast.  Sometimes boring but I usually watch it anyways. (https://amateurlogic.tv/transmitter/feeds/ipod.xml)

Amateurlogic: a great ham radio (and a little bit more) vieo podcast.  A lot of making and hacking going on in this one. (https://amateurlogic.tv/transmitter/feeds/ipod.xml)


Science Podcast

Radiolab: NPR radio podcast.  Good interesting science. (https://feeds.wnyc.org/radiolab)

Star Talk: Neil DeGrasse Tyson's radio show.  Brings on guests to discuss sciene in a general audience way. (https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:38128127/sounds.rss)

This Week in Science: A good weekly roudtable science news podcast.  Used to be a TWiT show but has branched out on it's own. (https://feeds.feedburner.com/twis/science/)


Buddhism

I listen to a lot of random budhism podcasts but this is the must listen to.


Buddhist Geeks: Modern take on culture, science and society's impact on Budhism.  Tends to be academic, but I enjoy it. (https://feeds.feedburner.com/BuddhistGeeksPodcast)

Vedic Mythology and Mantras Podcast: While not Buddhist specifically I have always loved Vedic mythology and Indian music.  In my mind the relationship between the Vedic traditions and Buddhist are similar to Judaism to Christianity.  This podcast gies a short mythological story and a chant that goes along with it.  It's no longer being produced but it has lots of episodes to listen to.  (https://www.puja.net/wordpress/category/mythologypodcast/)
