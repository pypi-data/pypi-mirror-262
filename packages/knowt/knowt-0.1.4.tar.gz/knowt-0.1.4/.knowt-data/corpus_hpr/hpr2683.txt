## hpr2683 :: Using Open source tools to visualize the heartrate and blood oxygen saturation level of my stepchild

 Using Python, PHP, JQuery and Linux to visualize the heartrate and blood oxygen saturation level of my stepdaughter.
Jeroen Baten talks about how he used his knowledge of a couple of open source tools to visualize the heartrate and oxygen saturation in the blood of one of his children and how this aided a pediatrician at the Wilhelmina childrens hospital to come to the right conclusion and treatment. This talk is a mix of tech and 43 surgery sessions on one single human being.
