In today's episode Ken talks to Moose one of the organizers of Ohio Linux Fest

About the Ohio LinuxFest
The Ohio LinuxFest is a grassroots conference for the GNU/Linux/Open Source Software/Free Software community that started in 2003 as a large inter-LUG meeting and has grown steadily since. It is a place for the community to gather and share information about Linux and Open Source Software.
A large expo area adjacent to the conference rooms will feature exhibits from our sponsors as well as a large .org section from non-profit Open Source/Free Software projects.
The Ohio LinuxFest welcomes people from all 50 states and international participants. We've had participants from Canada, England, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia in years past.

We understand that some people need special assistance to fully enjoy our conference. If we can help you find a wheelchair, arrange for an ASL translator or a guide for the sight impaired, or any other special need, please let us know at assist@ohiolinux.org.  Sorry, we cannot help with child care needs. Please understand that organizing some things take time and are best pre-arranged.
