## hpr1301 :: Conversation with Nybill and Jon Kulp

 While I am on vacation near New York City, fellow HPR host NYbill drives down from 
upstate and we meet for the first time face-to-face. Of course we 
have to record a conversation for posterity. Topics include 
activities at LUG meetings, Cory Doctorow, Neal Stephenson, 
blather speech recognition (a live demonstration!), guitars, and more. Outtakes after the outro.
