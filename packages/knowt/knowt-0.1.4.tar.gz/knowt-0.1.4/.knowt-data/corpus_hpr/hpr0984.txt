## hpr0984 :: Going Linux: Introduction to Podcasting with Linux

 
In this introduction to using Linux and Linux applications to record a podcast, we focus on doing it on the cheap. We reveal the hardware and software we use. We discuss that you don't have to have a fast, new computer and expensive recording equipment to make a good quality podcast recording. From recording to editing, and from creating a feed to creating a supporting website, we talk about the free and open source software we use. We also give some tips on the logistics of the recording process and hosting your audio files for free.
