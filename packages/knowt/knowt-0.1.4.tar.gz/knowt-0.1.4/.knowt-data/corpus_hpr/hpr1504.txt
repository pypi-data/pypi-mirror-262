## hpr1504 :: HPR at NELF 2014 Afterparty

 
In this episode, Members of the HPR community, and attendees of NELF share their thoughts about the 2014 Northeast GNU/Linux Fest. Sorry for the dynamic range of this one. I levelled it out the best I could. Also sorry for getting this out so late. RL has been kicking my ass lately.


Some interesting things that were mentioned that may be worth checking out:

The Zoom H1 Recorders are fantastic devices, and we need to thank the HPR community for chipping in to buy one. They definitely pick up more sound than I did when the podcast was being recorded. I heard things in playback that I wish I had heard and addressed during the live recording. 


Thanks to Richard Stallman for the lyrics to the Free Software Song


Thanks to The GNU/Stallmans for their performance of the Free Software Song on the RevolutionOS documentary. https://www.revolution-os.com/


We all had a great time recording this show, and we hope you enjoyed it as well. Please join us at the next Northeast Gnu/Linux Fest if you can. Thank you very much for listening.


Sincerely,
The HPR conference crew
