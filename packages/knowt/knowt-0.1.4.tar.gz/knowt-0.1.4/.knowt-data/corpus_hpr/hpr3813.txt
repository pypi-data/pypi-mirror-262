#28 FOSDEM 2023 Special
Between the Saturday closing of FOSDEM 2023 and going to a restaurant, we
managed to squeeze around a table outside the cafeteria to record the very
first ever in-person postmarketOS podcast episode! Fresh in the moment we share
our experiences from the FOSS on mobile devroom, meeting great people at the
Linux on Mobile stand (and everywhere else at FOSDEM/in Brussels) and random
other cool things that were going down.
Featuring @spaetz (sampled in the intro), @ollieparanoid, @linmob, @craftyguy,
@MartijnBraam, @calebccff, @PureTryOut, @z3ntu (in order of appearance).

PinePhone and Lima / Mesa:
We're aware that
mesa#8198
is still causing problems for people on the PinePhone. Big thanks to @enues
from mesa who was talking to us at the stand and is now looking into it! We
also have issue
pmaports#805 about
screen freezes. If you are affected by this and would like to help out, firing
up a profiler and making/contributing to detailed, useful bugreports upstream
at mesa is appreciated.
@spaetz from Mobian did a great job at moderating the devroom! (Correction:
Ollie said from Maemo instead of Mobian in the recording.)
