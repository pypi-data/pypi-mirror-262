"Lost udev episode"
I was surprised to hear you say you've never done an episode on udev, because I distinctly remember that episode! You were discussing creating your own udev rules to automatically run tasks upon inserting a USB drive.

It may be that you've never done an episode on HPR about it; I can't find it for the life of me.

Either way, thank you - as always - for the excellent episode. :)

"a good idea"
Hi,
Thank you for this program and the introduction as a podcast.

I just downloaded the .zip from GitLab and while trying the commands, I realize a section with dependencies is missing. I think pip is too large, so, I usually do run it in an virtualenv.
In other Phython projects like here: https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/blob/master/requirements.txt you find a requirements.txt. I was wondering if you add one too?

Br,
Reto
