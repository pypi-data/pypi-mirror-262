## hpr1516 :: 01 The podcasts I listen to

 I listen to a lot of podcasts. I started listening to them back in around 2005 after buying my first portable player.
I now listen to podcasts to the exclusion of just about everything else and have several players which I rotate between. I gave up watching TV over two years ago. I have written my own podcatcher software based upon Bashpodder, with a PostgreSQL database to manage everything, which holds feed, episode, playlist and player details.
My interests range from Astronomy to Virology with a bias towards IT-related subjects. I currently subscribe to 85 feeds, which I present to you here in two batches. I have attached my own category to each feed, so I can load all the Science episodes on one player, and Documentary episodes on another, and so forth. I have added the category to the list as well and have sorted the list by category and the title.
Note: The list below is generated by a script which performs a query on my database. I have relied on parsing the feeds themselves for the websites, using the link value. In a few cases the value is unfortunately incorrect or missing because the feed is mis-configured.
I have included an OPML version of the list in case you want to load it or part of it into your podcatcher. Find it at https://www.hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1516.opml
