## hpr1784 :: Intro to the Fugue and the Open Well-Tempered Clavier

 Intro to the Fugue
This episode of HPR is inspired by the recent release of a new recording by Kimiko Ishizaka of J.S. Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I. This is a very special recording because it is free and open, licensed to be shared freely forever. The recording was crowdfunded and immediately released with a public license after editing. This allows for legal remixing and sharing, and also makes it perfect for stuff like I do in this episodeâ€”cutting the recordings up for inserting as musical examples and then presenting the whole thing for your listening enjoyment.
