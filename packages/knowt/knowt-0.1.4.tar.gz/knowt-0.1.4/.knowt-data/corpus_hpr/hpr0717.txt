## hpr0717 :: My Switch from Windows to Linux

 First exposure to Linux on ancient laptop
Next several years into adulthood with Windows
Never ran with crowd / always techie
Opinions formed about Linux
In spite of fondness, abandonded Linux
Several years later 1 yr from retiring 
Dooms day - pop up virus explorer web page
All this arround the time Vista 
Stuck with XP through Vista debachle
Learned some things about Windows7 proverbial straw
Devising a plan
Ubunto on desktop and on wifes laptop
Only remnants of windows on dual boot desktop
Purchased my own Vista laptop / never booted in Vista
Learned alot using Ubuntu
Thats my switch to linux story
More productive, knowledgeable, satisfied user under Linux
