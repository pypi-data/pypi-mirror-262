## hpr3559 :: Linux Inlaws S01E52: The Zig Project

 In this episode Martin and Chris have a very special guest: Loris Cro of
Zig fame. Zig fame?  Stay tuned. Not only is Loris an ex-colleague of our two
aging heroes, he is also the community vice president at the Zig Software
Foundation. So this episode will be all about this new programming language,
why you should use it (and perhaps why you shouldn't) and life, the universe
and the rest. And Rust. Of course. :-) Full disclosure: In contrast to other
episodes, this one is really tech-heavy and may offend the less technical
listeners. Listen at your own discretion if you want to into the weeds of
Clang, LLVM, typing and cross-compilation - you have been warned. If this is
up alley, you may want consider seeking professional help just in case :-).
