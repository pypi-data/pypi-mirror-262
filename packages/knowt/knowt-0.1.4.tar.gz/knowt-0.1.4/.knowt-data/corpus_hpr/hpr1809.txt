## hpr1809 :: My "New" Used Kindle Touch

 In this show I talk about why I like to buy stuff used whenever possible, whether it be printers, routers, shirts, books, or my latest acquisition, a used Kindle Touch, which in many ways is much better than my (much newer) Kindle paperwhite. Just for fun, I allow the Kindle Touch itself (using its built-in text-to-speech capabilities) to tell me the ways in which it's better than the Kindle Paperwhite.
