Please forgive the audio quality of this recording. Due to the acoustics of the room, and my crappy mic, I had to "massage" the recording an awful lot to be able to hear all three people at a reasonable level without overwhelming you with background noise. I did my best.


I want to thank Donald and Matt for making it such a great interview. They were firendly, respectful, and kind. I had a great time with them durring the interview, and at the afterparty. They represent the FSF well.
