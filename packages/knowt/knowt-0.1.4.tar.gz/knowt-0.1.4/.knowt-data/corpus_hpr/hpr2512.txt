## hpr2512 :: Intro to git remote

 
Instantiate a git repo:


$ mkdir alice
$ cd !$
$ git init


Add a remote:


$ git remote add origin URI_OF_REMOTE


Change a remote:


$ git remote set-url origin NEW_URI


A remote can be a server, it can be a local directory, an NFS share, pretty much whatever you want.


It is a Git convention that the primary remote is called origin. You don't have to call it that, but it's pretty common.
