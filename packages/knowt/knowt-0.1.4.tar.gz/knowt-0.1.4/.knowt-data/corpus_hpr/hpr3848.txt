## hpr3848 :: Editing Thunderbird email filters using vim.

 Prerequisites:

Backups of ALL your data (especially your
Thunderbird directory).

Confirm your backups are working as expected.

Vim text editor installed with at least a basic/novice level
knowledge of vim.

Thunderbird email client installed with at least a basic/novice
level knowledge of the Thunderbird email client.

Web browser (preferably Firefox).


Thunderbird Directories.
I’m on a GNU/Linux system (Pop_OS!) and I have Thunderbird installed
via the apt system package manager (.deb).

System package manager install.

$HOME/.thunderbird/

Snap package manager install.

$HOME/snap/.thunderbird/

Flatpak package manager install.

$HOME/.var/.thunderbird/

Windows 10 install.

C:\Users\your-account\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\

Your Thunderbird email filters are located in this subdirectory
(msgFilterRules.dat).

$HOME/.thunderbird/*.default-release/ImapMail/imap.email-accounts.com/msgFilterRules.dat


Vim Directories.
I’ve created subdirectories within $HOME/.config/ as a
place to store my vim sessions. You may not have these directories on
your system, but you can create them using the mkdir
command.


$HOME/.config/vim/sessions/session-files-here.vim

Vim session file.
I’ve created session files for purposes of editing my Thunderbird
email filters. This session only stores the shortcuts needed to make
flawless edits to my email filters. I will share them with you.
