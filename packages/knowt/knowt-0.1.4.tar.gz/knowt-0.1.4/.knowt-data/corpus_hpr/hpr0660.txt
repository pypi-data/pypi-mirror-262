## hpr0660 :: An argument against emulators when retrocomputing

 
I was moved by Ken Fallon's cry for submissions, so here's my first podcast:  An argument against using emulators when retrocomputing.  In short, there are some semi-intangible things you can't get from an emulator that you can only get from the real hardware, so use real hardware when you can.  Examples contained within.


Mentioned or hinted at on the show:


Andrew Jenner's proposal to rewrite the CRTC emulation for MESS: https://www.reenigne.org/blog/crtc-emulation-for-mess/


Ian Bogost's work on adding more realistic display techniques to Stella, a 2600 emulator:  https://www.bogost.com/games/a_television_simulator.shtml
