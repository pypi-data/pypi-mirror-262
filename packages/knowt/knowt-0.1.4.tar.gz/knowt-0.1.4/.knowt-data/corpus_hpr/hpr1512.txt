## hpr1512 :: Adopting and Renovating a Public-Domain Counterpoint Textbook

 
In this episode I discuss the problem of increasingly expensive college textbooks, and share with you the solution I devised to combat the problem in my counterpoint class at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.


Part of the solution is to adopt a public-domain textbook that's more than 100 years old, and to give the text a 21st-century makeover that I believe will make it even better-suited for the digital age than any other comparable book in the market at any price.

Percy Goetschius: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Goetschius entitled "Exercises in Elementary Counterpoint."
