## hpr2887 :: Stardrifter RPG Playtest Part 01

 
This episode begins a limited series covering the first playtest of a new role-playing game, based upon my Stardrifter series of books and short stories. The series is composed of two playtest sessions, held earlier this year. They were recorded and chopped into manageable bites, then edited down into separate episodes.


This series is meant to give listeners some insight into the RPG construction process. Playtesting is not the final step, but rather, just another stage. The construction of an RPG can be convoluted, and feedback from players is absolutely vital.


In this first episode, as well as the next, we we go over the rules of the game, and discuss them in some detail.


Special thanks to my playtesters: Klaatu, Thaj, Mark (who was playing Brinn), and Brian!
