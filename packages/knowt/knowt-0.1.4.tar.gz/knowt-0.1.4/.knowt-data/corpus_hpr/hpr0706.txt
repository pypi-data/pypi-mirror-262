## hpr0706 :: What to do when confronted with a blind person

 
If you are in the way of a blind person say "hi" so they know you're there.
If a blind person is looking for a seat, tell them where there is a vacant space.
Ask if they need help (warning not all people might appreciate this)
"See you later", "Did you watch this movie" doesn't bother Jonathan but some people may be bothered.
When leading a blind person (across the street), walk normally and let the blind person hang on to your elbow.
