 Hacking my inner ear
In April 2015 I suddenly found myself getting dizzy as I bent down – to the extent where I actually fell over at one point. I went to see a doctor but didn’t get a diagnosis.
A medical student I know suggested it might be BPPV - Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, and with that in mind I researched it and found what turned out to be a cure.
