## hpr2027 :: Old Engineers and New Engineers

 
This is a short episode about a puzzle that I got for my birthday from my in-laws.  I gave the puzzle to two of my children to solve after I'd taken a crack at it.  It was amusing to see see how and old engineer thought about the problem compared with young ones.  Pictures of the puzzle are attached.  The object is to get one ball in each notch at the end of the block at the same time.
