## hpr1713 :: Fosdem 2015: Surveillance vs. Free Software

 Aaron Williamson

Free Software Law Expert Aaron Williamson held a brilliant talk on the history of internet surveillance in the USA at FOSDEM 2015. 
After the Paris terror attacks, many politicians want to increase surveillance. British Prime Minister David Cameron wants to read all our emails - even the encrypted ones. Is this the only answer to terror attacks? Aaron has a very strong opinion on this.
