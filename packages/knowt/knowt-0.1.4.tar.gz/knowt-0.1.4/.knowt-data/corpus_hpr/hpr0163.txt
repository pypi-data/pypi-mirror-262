Circuit bending is the creative, DIY (Do It Yourself) short-circuiting of electronic devices such as low voltage, battery-powered guitar effects, children's toys and small digital synthesizers to create new musical instruments and sound generators. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with noise music, though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with "bent" instruments. Circuit benders remove the rear panel and connect circuits on a trial and error basis. More experienced benders use a soldering iron and add other components such as potentiometers, resistors or capacitors, which creates an even broader range of sounds.
