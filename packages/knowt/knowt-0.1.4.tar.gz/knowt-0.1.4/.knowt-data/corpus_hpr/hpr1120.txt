## hpr1120 :: Jerome Leclanche from the razor-qt project

 
Razor-qt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments, Razor-qt also works fine with weak machines.

The Razor-qt team is proud to release version 0.5.0. It is the culmination of all our efforts since our last release in February of 2012.
There have been several improvements and added features for 0.5.0, as noted in the Change Log, but the most noticeable are:

New Appearance GUI for configuring themes
Several new plugins for added functionality
Many bug fixes resulting in better performance
New Notification daemon

 The Razor-qt team would like to thank its staff of 8 members for all the hard work, and the community as well, for all the support. A list of the Razor-qt development team is available  here, on github.
