## hpr1172 :: LiTS 022: Sort

 The sort command does just that, it sorts input.  Input can be a list of files, standard in, or files with standard in. The first example presents this simple file, shopping.txt,  containing a list of items:
chicken
fish
sour cream
bread crumbs
milk
eggs
bread
sinkers
fishing hooks
Issuing the sort command on this file:
sort shopping.txt
Would present the following output:
bread
bread crumbs
chicken
eggs
fish
fishing hooks
milk
sinkers
sour cream
