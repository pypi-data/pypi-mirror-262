## hpr2199 :: Replacing the Throttle Position Sensor on My Truck

 When the "check engine" light came on in my truck again, it turned out to be the throttle position sensor just like when I very first bought the truck about a year-and-a-half ago. That time, I was able to fix it by spraying contact cleaner on it, but this time that didn't work. I ordered a new part. In this episode I talk while I replace the part and I also talk about the nifty diagnostic tool that I used to get the trouble code and how it sends the information to your smartphone.

What you can gather with the torque diagnostic tool for Android:

View live OBD engine data on your Android phone - Connect to your vehicle ECU
Fully customisable dashboard screens - Design your own layouts and custom dials, use your own themes
Retrieve Fault Codes (DTCs) and clear Check Engine lights - View fault descriptions using the built-in databases
Upload live OBD2 data to your webserver or the torque web viewer in realtime
Check the performance of your vehicle with BHP / Torque / 0-60 & Quarter Mile widgets
