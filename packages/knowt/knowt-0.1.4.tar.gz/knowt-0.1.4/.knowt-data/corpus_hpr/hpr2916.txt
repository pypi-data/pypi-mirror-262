Tags and Summaries
Thanks to the following contributor for sending in updates in the past month: windigo
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 1 show which was without them.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
Change to the Missing Tags document
The section of this document which lists all of the tags currently in the system has been made more accessible. If you know of a tag in the system and you want to find out how many instances there are and which shows use them you can construct a query of the form:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php#vim
This would look for the tag 'vim' and position the page at the relevant place.
If the tag you are looking for contains spaces, you need to replace them with underscores. So to look for the tag 'vietnamese stringed instruments' your query would have to be:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php#vietnamese_stringed_instruments
