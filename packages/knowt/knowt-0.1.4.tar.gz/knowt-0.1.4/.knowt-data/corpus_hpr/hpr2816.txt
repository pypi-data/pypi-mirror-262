## hpr2816 :: Gnu Awk - Part 14

 Introduction
This is the fourteenth episode of the “Learning Awk” series which is being produced by b-yeezi and myself.
In this episode and the next I want to start looking at redirection within Awk programs. I had originally intended to cover the subject in one episode, but there is just too much.
So, in the first episode I will be starting with output redirection and then in the next episode will spend some time looking at the getline command used for explicit input, often with redirection.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
