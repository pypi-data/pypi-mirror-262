## hpr1796 :: Audacity - Chains, Notches and Labels

 
I expand some on Jon Kulp's  show on using Labels in Audacity. Specifically, I comment on importing a Label track from a Tab separated text file.


I go on to talk about using Notch filters, a Nyquist-effect plugin for Audacity. Notch filters work extremely well on certain frequency centered noise like mains hum.



I follow up by talking about chains. A way of doing batch operations directly in Audacity.
