## hpr0852 :: GNU Emacs 1

 A small mini series (three parts) on GNU Emacs; Klaatu tells you how to use it, when to use it and when not to, why you'd want to use it, and most of all - how to become a pro on it!  Not a sales pitch for Emacs, just a harmless introduction.  First try is free.



GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and
more.  At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of
the Lisp programming language with extensions to
support text editing.  The features of GNU Emacs include:

Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a
variety of file types including plain text, source code, and
HTML.
Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new
users.
Full Unicode support for nearly
all human languages and their scripts.
Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical
interface.
A large number of extensions that add other functionality, including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger
interface,
calendar, and more. Many of these extensions are distributed with GNU Emacs; others are available separately.
