Processing Standards.


The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of the United
States are a set of publicly announced standards that the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed for use in
computer systems of non-military, American government agencies and
contractors. FIPS standards establish requirements for ensuring computer
security and interoperability, and are intended for cases in which
suitable industry standards do not already exist. Many FIPS
specifications are modified versions of standards the technical
communities use, such as the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),
and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

General Information.

FIPS are standards and guidelines for federal computer systems that
are developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) and approved by the Secretary of Commerce. These standards and
guidelines are developed when there are no acceptable industry standards
or solutions for a particular government requirement. Although FIPS are
developed for use by the federal government, many in the private sector
voluntarily use these standards.

General KeePassXC Information.

Why KeePassXC instead of KeePassX?

KeePassX is an amazing password manager, but hasn't seen much active
development for quite a while. Many good pull requests were never merged
and the original project is missing some features which users can expect
from a modern password manager. Hence, we decided to fork KeePassX to
continue its development and provide you with everything you love about
KeePassX plus many new features and bugfixes.


Why KeePassXC instead of KeePass?

KeePass is a very proven and feature-rich password manager and there
is nothing fundamentally wrong with it. However, it is written in C# and
therefore requires Microsoft's .NET platform. On systems other than
Windows, you can run KeePass using the Mono runtime libraries, but you
won't get the native look and feel which you are used to.

KeePassXC, on the other hand, is developed in C++ and runs natively
on all platforms giving you the best-possible platform
integration.


Why is there no cloud synchronization feature built into
KeePassXC?

Cloud synchronization with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive,
ownCloud, Nextcloud etc. can be easily accomplished by simply storing
your KeePassXC database inside your shared cloud folder and letting your
desktop synchronization client do the rest. We prefer this approach,
because it is simple, not tied to a specific cloud provider and keeps
the complexity of our code low.


KeePassXC allows me to store my TOTP secrets. Doesn't this alleviate
any advantage of two-factor authentication?

Yes. But only if you store them in the same database as your
password. We believe that storing both together can still be more secure
than not using 2FA at all, but to maximize the security gain from using
2FA, you should always store TOTP secrets in a separate database,
secured with a different password, possibly even on a different
computer.


How do I use the KeePassXC CLI tool with the AppImage?

Starting with version 2.2.2, you can run the KeePassXC CLI tool from
the AppImage by executing it with the cli argument:

./KeePassXC-*.AppImage cli



Additional Information.

What Is Infinite Scrolling?

Infinite scrolling is a technique that loads more content as you
scroll. It allows you to continue scrolling indefinitely and is
sometimes known as endless scrolling.
