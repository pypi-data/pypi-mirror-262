## hpr3083 :: Mumbling while on lockdown

 Introduction
Two HPR hosts based in Edinburgh got together over Mumble to have a chat during the COVID-19 lockdown.

MrX
Dave Morriss

Apology
Dave’s sound was a bit distorted in this recording. Having had recent problems using the Zoom recorder as a microphone, this time the in-built microphone was resorted to, with even worse results it turned out. See the Sound processing section below if you want to know more.
Notes
Some of the topics we discussed

Locations for recording. Ambient noises.
WiFi versus ethernet. Dave has a 5-port switch on his dining table (not 8-port).
ADSL routers
Linksys NSLU2 "SLUG"
SheevaPlug
CUPS - printing and scanning with old non-networked printers
Legacy computing experiences:

Diablo exchangeable disks
Line printers. Fan-fold 132 column paper
Punched card experiences. Card sequence numbers. Card sorters.
Checking disks for warped platters
Magnetic tapes; recovering from damage.

Sound processing
 The recording was made in multichannel mode in anticipation of problems. The distorted channel was processed by using the Clip Fix effect in Audacity, which didn’t seem to change much except reduce the sound level. It was also necessary to find and remove sounds produced by the push to talk key presses. Removal meant replacing these sounds by silence so the two channels would not get out of step. After this the two channels were merged together and silences truncated. 
 Lessons learned: don’t use a built-in microphone if you can help it!
