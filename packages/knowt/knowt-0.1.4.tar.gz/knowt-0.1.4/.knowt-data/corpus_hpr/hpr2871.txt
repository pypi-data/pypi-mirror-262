Ohio LinuxFest Conference CFP
From Susan Rose, Social Media Manager for OLF:

Dear Open Source Fans, Students and Professionals:
The 2019 Ohio LinuxFest is looking for presentations on Friday and Saturday, November 1 and 2. Please visit the CFP page https://ohiolinux.org/call-for-presentations/ for full details about submitting a proposal. The deadline is Friday, August 17, but the sooner you can submit a talk, the better.
Started in 2003, the Ohio LinuxFest https://ohiolinux.org/ is an annual grassroots conference in Columbus, Ohio dedicated to open access for all. Presentations relating to any free and open source software, not just Linux, are welcome. Areas where weâ€™ve had talks in the past include networking, system administration, development, and community building. A preliminary pdf brochure is attached.
Our audience consists of people at all skill levels. Prior speaking experience is a plus, although we do try to provide opportunities for first-time speakers. If you have any questions, please contact us at speakers@ohiolinux.org. We look forward to hearing from you! Thank you for your kind attention and for sharing.

The PDF Brochure mentioned is available at https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr2871/olf2019.pdf.
Problem with show 2855
We upload all HPR shows to the Internet Archive (archive.org). Shows downloaded via the HPR RSS feeds actually come from there, though they are also available on the HPR site.
Unfortunately, on Friday July 12th the archive.org copy of the show hpr2855 :: HPR NYE Show 2018-2019 part 6 was found to have been truncated and to consist only of the introduction and final part; no actual content.
The problem was detected during the morning of Friday and was rectified during the afternoon (UK time). The RSS feeds were adjusted to ensure the show was re-downloaded and all podcatchers should have received the correct version the next time they checked the feed.
Tags and Summaries
Thanks to the following contributor for sending in updates in the past month: Dave Morriss
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 11 shows which were without them.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
