New HPR Community Spokesperson for 2012
Communities like Debian and Fedora regularly change the person in the position of community manager so that the community is better represented, ideas are kept fresh and team work is fostered. With this in mind we are looking for a new member of the community to come forward and represent HPR as the community spokesperson.
The job is focused on encouraging people to contribute to the project, spreading the word and building the community.
If you are interested or would like to suggest someone for the position then please send your comments to the Mail list. Don't worry Ken and all the other 'regulars' will continue to support HPR.
Give to FLOSS
Paying homage to the tradition started my Chess Griffin of Linux Reality we are asking people to contribute financially over the coming month to a FLOSS of CC project. Just email us what you contributed to and we'll mail you one of the last few HPR stickers and give you a shout out on the end of year show. Please Spread the word!
End of Year show
We will be organizing a open mic end of year show next month so please have your "best of hpr" story ready for the event. More information on time and date to follow. If you can't make it to the live recording, then please record a short segment and send it on in.
Contribute Shows
We're short of shows so please stop procrastinating and record that show today. https://hackerpublicradio.org/contribute.php has more information on how to do that.
