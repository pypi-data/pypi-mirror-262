## hpr2454 :: The Alien Brothers Podcast - S01E02 - Strictly Hacking

 Casper and Rutiger attempt to STAY ON TARGET by discussing hacking… which when you think about it is an utterly pretentious and vague goal for a podcast presented by Hacker Public Radio, especially when considering the end result. Shame on us!
Other topics include Friendsgiving and giving thanks; probably the greatest gaming console of the 1970’s; early “hackings” (sic) committed by the hosts; << >>

Although we referred to the Chapter 8 material on system network security during the show, Rutiger decided it was better to release chapters, incrementally, in order let listeners gain a fuller appreciation for the work. Rutiger is also attempting to track down the original author, who never publicly released the work, to gain retroactive permission for this link, but for the moment Alien Brothers Podcast takes full responsibility for allowing access to this non-copyrighted work and we’ll just go ahead, you know, feel good about the possibility it will all turn out OK.
