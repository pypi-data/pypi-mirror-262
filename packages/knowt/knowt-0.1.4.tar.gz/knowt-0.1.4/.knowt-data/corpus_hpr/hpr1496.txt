## hpr1496 :: wiki on the raspberry pi

 
My experience of playing with wiki software on the raspberry pi, I forgot to mention I run the standard Raspbian distribution on my pi
if you run something else your mileage may vary.


When I listened to the show I noticed a few mistakes, there may be others as the show was pulled together rather hastily


1. The raspberry pi has either 256 or 512 MB of memory Not KB's oops


2. You can automatically create pages using camel-case words they don't need to start with the word wiki so in my example the page WikiNotes
could just as easily be called GuffNotes. This is because at first I didnt appreciate the meaning of the word camelcase, you learn something 
new every day!


3. Wikidot still provides a free account, oops again!
