## hpr1103 :: Thoughtkindness: In Defense of Media Freetardation

 It took 14 months longer than intended to get this episode done! To make up 
for it, I've unintentionally ended up with enough time of me talking to almost
make up a minimal-useful-sized episode every month while everyone's been 
waiting.
Today's episode of "Thoughtkindness" consists of:

Me begging for forgiveness for disappearing for a year.
An update on "bunnies", my linux laptop from Ohava Computers
Over an hour of my attempt to collect and explain why we need 
to make media on the internet more "freetarded"

After revealing what ticked me off and made me start on this episode, I 
launch into a short technical and historical talk about the handful of audio 
and video files that matter on the web today.
(Opus, Ogg Vorbis, WebM, MP3, Flash Video, MP4, and a few others).
Following this, I explain why I think the legally-free media formats are
so important, and much more useful than most people seem to recognize, why
I think we need to be paying more attention to audio than video, and what
needs to happen to make legally-free media ubiquitous.
I conclude by once again begging for attention and foolishly publically
announcing that I want to try to develop some software and invite everyone
to pester me for it as well as for future audio shows. Maybe I won't be 
allowed to procrastinate for another year before producing more this time.
Let me know if this is helpful or at least entertaining...
