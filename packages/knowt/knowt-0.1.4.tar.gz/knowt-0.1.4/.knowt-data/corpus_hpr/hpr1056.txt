## hpr1056 :: OggCamp 12 Day 1 Part 1

 This is the first of an all week extravaganza covering the party that was OggCamp 12. It was held on August 18 / 19 2012 in the Art & Design Academy Liverpool John Moores University Liverpool, L3 5RD
The levels are all over the place and I don’t have the time to edit it further as I’ve been traveling all day. So in the spirit of HPR, I’ll put content over audio quality and release it as is.
