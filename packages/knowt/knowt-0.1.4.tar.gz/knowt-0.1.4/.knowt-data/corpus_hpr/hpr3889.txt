COMM(1)                               User Commands                              COMM(1)

NAME
       comm - compare two sorted files line by line

SYNOPSIS
       comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

DESCRIPTION
       Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.

       When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.

       With no options, produce three-column output.  Column one contains lines unique to FILE1,
       column two contains lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both
       files.

       -1     suppress column 1 (lines unique to FILE1)

       -2     suppress column 2 (lines unique to FILE2)

       -3     suppress column 3 (lines that appear in both files)

       --check-order
              check that the input is correctly sorted, even if all input lines are pairable

       --nocheck-order
              do not check that the input is correctly sorted

       --output-delimiter=STR
              separate columns with STR

       --total
              output a summary

       -z, --zero-terminated
              line delimiter is NUL, not newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note, comparisons honor the rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.

EXAMPLES
       comm -12 file1 file2
              Print only lines present in both file1 and file2.

       comm -3 file1 file2
              Print lines in file1 not in file2, and vice versa.

GNU coreutils 9.1
I always find that confusing, so for me it's a lot easier to see what
is going on by creating some example files.
First let's create some test files by echoing the number 1 and the
number 2 into a file called 1and2.txt
[host@hpr]$ echo "1" > 1and2.txt
[host@hpr]$ echo "2" >> 1and2.txt
And let's create another one with the value 2 and 3 and we'll call it
2and3.txt
[host@hpr]$ echo "2" > 2and3.txt
[host@hpr]$ echo "3" >> 2and3.txt
Then we can see what each command does using these examples.
[host@hpr]$ comm -1 -2 1and2.txt 2and3.txt
2
[host@hpr]$ comm -1 -3 1and2.txt 2and3.txt
3
[host@hpr]$ comm -2 -3 1and2.txt 2and3.txt
1
