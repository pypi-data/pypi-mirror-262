## hpr1649 :: Raspberry Pi Accessibility Breakthrough

 
Since April last year the text-to-speech using eSpeak in the Raspberry Pi
console has stuttered very badly and regularly crashes the kernel.


Here's how I fixed it.


Cloning my github repo:


git clone https://github.com/cromarty/ttsprojects.git


Installation:


cd ttsprojects/raspberry-pi/libilctts/build
sudo ./build.sh
cd ../../piespeakup
sudo ./build.sh


Bingo!  Speech should work.


This has only just been released and there is still work to do on the
documentation.


Note: I am not connected to the Raspberry Pi Foundation in any way
and anything I say or do is not endorsed by them.


My email address is connected with a Freelists email list I set up and
an accompanying web site:


https://www.raspberryvi.org/


The 'VI' is for 'Visually Impaired' and I DID check with the
Foundation about the similarity of the web address before I created it.
