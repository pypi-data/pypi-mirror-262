The HPR Booth Banner is LOST! Shipped to wrong address and 'POOF' its gone! What should we do in the future? Buy 2 replacement banners or extra frames What about something doing something else?
Pokey saw a really lightweight banner in a bank -

There should be a PDF with these show notes that has a shitty logo page so you can see some stickers that can be ordered. The stickers are very good quality as are the T-shirts. Richard Querin and others have done the artwork.
