## hpr1386 :: Hacking Public Policy: The Underground Press

 
In this Hacker Public Radio episode Bob Tregilus continues an exploration on how to hack public policy. Because outreach and education is so critical to building a successful movement, Tregilus talks to Ken Wachsberger of Lansing, Michigan, about the underground press of the late '60s and early '70s. Wachsberger was involved with the "Joint Issue," an underground paper serving southeastern Michigan.


Questions addressed and answered include:


The history of the underground press.

Constraints on leisure time in the '60s vs. the 2000s.

Differences between the underground press, the alternative press, and the corporate press.

Community organizing in the '60s vs. the 2000s.

Social issues of the '60s vs. the 2000s.

And more!
