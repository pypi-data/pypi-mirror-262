## hpr3542 :: The Worst Car I Ever Had

 Most of us who drive have probably owned a number of cars over the years. Some are inevitably better than others but there may be one which stands head and shoulders above the rest as the WORST car we've ever owned.
In this episode Beeza gets off his chest a tale of woe regarding a rogue car he had the misfortune to own in the mid 80s.
Maybe other HPR listeners will care to tell their own horror stories in due course......
