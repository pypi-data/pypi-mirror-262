## hpr0377 :: Future of Artificial Intelligence in Open Source

 Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence have enabled a basic computer system with no additional components to advance from a beginner in chess, to a master level in less than 300 games. This presentation will examine what a learning algorithm consists of, and why it may be important to Open Source in the future. By the end of this presentation the audience should have a foundational knowledge of what AI is and whether it may be useful in their own projects.
