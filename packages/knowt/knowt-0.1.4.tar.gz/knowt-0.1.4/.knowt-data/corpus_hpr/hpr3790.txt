## hpr3790 :: Tucson, Part 2

 We wrap up our stay in Tucson, Arizona and move over to Benson, Arizona, not far from Tucson. Here we will stay for a month. And we don't run out of things to do. This was one of our favorite stops of the trip. In this episode we visit an old west movie set, Saguaro National Park, and tour a copper mine.
