## hpr0345 :: Editing the auto-generated menu in Linux

 Locations

Menu files (requires root to edit)

/usr/shar/applications


Icon files

/usr/share/pixmaps
/usr/share/icons/foo

Edit files in plain text editor like GEdit

Ellements pointed out in episode (there are plenty more, they vary per app, & distro)

Name : the name it will display on the menu (may need to change Name[foo] to reflect your language)
Language : speaks for itself
Comment : the rollover text
Exec : the command it will execute when clicked
Icon : the path to the icon shown in the menu
OnlyShowIn : useful when trying to find why an application may not be showing the menu
Terminal : runs the command in a terminal
Categories : (I think) this is the submenu groups where it'll appear on the menu

Changes sometimes take a little while to update, restarting X or rebooting will force it to re-read that folder and apply the changes.
XCFE Tip

Right click to edit menu. Click on something like a separator, move it up, then down to it's original place. Save.
