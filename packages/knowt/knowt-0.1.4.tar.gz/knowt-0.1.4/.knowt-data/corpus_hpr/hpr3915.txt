## hpr3915 :: Why the hell is my audio clipping?

 This is an emergency show as we are short of shows. I was going to do
this show anyway as I noticed my audio was clipping on the last few
shows I sent in yet I didn't notice it on the files I sent to HPR.
In this episode I waffle a bit and read out some of the stuff on the
HPR site about giving shows. During the recording I introduce increasing
amounts of attenuation each decrease in volume signified by a gong. I
hope this will allow me to stop the clipping from my audio.
