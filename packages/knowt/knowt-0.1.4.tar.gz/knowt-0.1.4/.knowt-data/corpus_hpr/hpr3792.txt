## hpr3792 :: Learning to read music, part one

 Although many people can create music easily enough on their
computers, not as many can read the traditional stave-and-dots notation
that have been in use for hundreds of years.
In less than half an hour, you can grasp the basics of reading music
in a way that's as natural as putting one foot in front of the
other.
I'd advise either printing out the handout from https://enistello.info or
having it on a screen you can see easily while outdoors. But it's not
essential!
Keep your eyes (and ears) peeled for part two of this series on
Hacker Public Radio, when I'll cover more complex rhythms and you'll
learn a lot more about pitch in written music.

The book I mention in this episode is The Songlines, by Bruce
Chatwin, published in 1987, and available from all good bookshops. Don't
buy it from Amazon, it only encourages them.
