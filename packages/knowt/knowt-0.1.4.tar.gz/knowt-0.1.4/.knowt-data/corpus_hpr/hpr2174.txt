## hpr2174 :: Dungeoneer Tabletop Game

 
Klaatu reviews the RPG card game, Dungeoneer, especially concentrating upon solitaire play.


If you're keen to play, you'll want to use Klaatu's re-write of the official rules, or his re-write and touch-up of the unofficial solo rules. Neither of these are unique in themselves, but Klaatu humbly believes that they're a lot easier to comprehend than those online or in the box.
