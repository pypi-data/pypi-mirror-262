Dave Lee - Helped a great deal in getting me on board with Matrix bridging. Check out his other podcasts at The Other Side Podcast Network

Matrix.org is a Free, open source, and decentralized messaging system. One of the strong points of this system is its ability to bridge multiple protocols together into one interface.

Bridging to Freenode's IRC server is built into Matrix.org. If you already have a registered Nick on Freenode it is a simple process to associate your Matrix and Freenode accounts.
Steps to bridge to a Freenode IRC room

Start a direct message with @freenode_NickServ:matrix.org and send the command identify nick pass (replacing nick and pass with your credentials).
Direct message @appservice-irc:matrix.org with the command !storepass nick:pass
Join the room #freenode_#oggcastplanet:matrix.org. You can really join any room on freenode with #freenode_#CHANNAME:matrix.org
PROFIT!!!!
