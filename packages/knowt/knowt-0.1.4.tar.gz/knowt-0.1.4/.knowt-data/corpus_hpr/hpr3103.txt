## hpr3103 :: A warning about browser extensions and add-ons.

 
I started getting popups while going to safe websites in chromium-browser. I disabled all browser extensions and then turned them back on individually. I found one that which was causing the problem and it is no longer on the app store. It was however still working and had not been revoked on my browser.


Please check your extensions and add-ons to make sure they are regularly updated.
