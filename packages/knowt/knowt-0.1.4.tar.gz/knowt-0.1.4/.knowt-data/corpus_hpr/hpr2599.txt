## hpr2599 :: Fitting a 3.5mm adapter to a bluetooth receiver.

 
There was a time when the perfect lightweight podcast listening station was a sansa clip running Rockbox connected to a set of SHE3600/97 Philips In-Ear Headphones.

Alas Philips stopped producing the SHE3600/97. SanDisk reduced the specs of the clips, so Rockbox is no longer supported. We're left without a flexible option to listening to podcasts.


On the other hand the price of Android phones have fallen to sub €50 range, and blue tooth headsets can be had for €25, there is a possibility to have the portability while keeping the cost low.


I set out to convert the bluetooth headset to a accept generic 3.5mm sockets.



A new ear bud set with crappy in ear buds, and the hacked set.



Plays fine with large over ear headphones.



Also with small in ear buds, complete with Patent Pending ear identifier
