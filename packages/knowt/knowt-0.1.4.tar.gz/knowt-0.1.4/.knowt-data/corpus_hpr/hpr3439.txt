## hpr3439 :: Linux Inlaws S01E40: The One with the BSDs

 In this episode, Martin and Chris host an eclectic panel of contributors to
the *other* major FLOSS operating system family - you guessed it: the
flavours of the Berkeley Software Distribution (aka BSD among friends).
Disclaimer: you may be tempted to diverge from the Path of the
Righteousness also known as Linux and give this alternative a spin. So
this episode is *not* for the faint-hearted - listen at your own
discretion! Also: the true defective nature of our beloved (?) hosts' past
will be revealed - an episode not be missed despite the caveat! Plus
a refresher on spaced-out operating system concepts including library
operating systems and a rant on Android and friends. In addition to some
cool BSD trolling...
