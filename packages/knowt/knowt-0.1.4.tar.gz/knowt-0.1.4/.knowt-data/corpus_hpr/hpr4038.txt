## hpr4038 :: Network Attach Storage Options I Use Everyday

 HPR Podcast January 19, 2024
Here is a quick overview of the NAS systems/technology I use today
and what I have used in the past. Some NAS systems don’t have all the
features you want but today it’s becoming easier to make them do it with
a few configurations. Overall, NAS technology has grown over the years
and it’s blurred the lines in what we use to think of individual systems
now bundled up into single devices.
