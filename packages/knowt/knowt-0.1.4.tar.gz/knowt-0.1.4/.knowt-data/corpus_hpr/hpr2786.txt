## hpr2786 :: My YouTube Channels

 Hallo HPR listeners this is Tony Hughes again coming from Blackpool in the UK.
Recently Ahuka started a series on the YouTube channels that he subscribes to and this seems like a good topic to share some of my favourite YouTube channels. This time I’ll share some of the tech and Linux based channels I watch.
