Rust-Roller Dice Roller Tutorial Application
This is a simple dice rolling application that follows along with my Hacker Public Radio course on learning the rust programming language.
I will attempt to make the commits follow the episodes pretty closely with one commit after every episode with the episode number in the commit message.
Usage:
rust-roller <number-of-dice> <number-of-sides-per-die>
Output:
Dice: <value-of-die-1> <value-of-die-2> ...
Total: <sum-of-all-dice-values>
