## hpr2429 :: Interface Zero RPG Play

 The second session of Interface Zero RPG live play with Klaatu, Lobath, and Thaj.
This week, Chiawei and Syd reach Peter's apartment and do some quick detective work, and a little bit of minor bone-breaking.

If you're really keen to play, send Klaatu an email (Klaatu at the domain of this podcast, or member.fsf.org). The recording schedule is inflexible, Klaatu has oddly high standards for audio that he is inevitably compresses down to 64kbps, and the game has already started, but a new character or guest character is not out of the question!
No give-away this week, but we'll be giving a (digital) Pathfinder starter kit out next week.
