Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

Reminder - Stuff you need to know

HPR will stop as a project if there are not enough shows.
We do not syndicate shows not produced for HPR.
You are agreeing to license your show CC-BY-SA.
You have permission to redistribute your show in its entirety.
Your show will not be moderated.
Your show will be signaled as containing explicit content.
You determine where in the schedule your show will be released.
We use UTF-8 end to end.
Your show will be heard by an International Audience.
We also need emergency shows.
You will no longer be allowed to edit HPR pages on Wikipedia.

Reminder - Scheduling Guidelines

You must have your audio recording ready to upload before you pick a slot.
Always try and fill any free slots that are available in the upcoming two weeks.
If the queue is filling up then please consider leaving some slots free for new contributors.
If you have a non urgent show then find a empty week and schedule it then.
If you are uploading a series of shows, consider scheduling one every two weeks.

Older HPR shows on archive.org
This month 96 additional shows in the range 1-870 have been uploaded to the Internet Archive.
Since we don't want to upload shows without summaries or tags the old shows and tag and summary projects are now tied together. So we will be all the more welcoming of tag and summary updates submitted as described on the summary page.
Tags and Summaries
Thanks to the following contributor for sending in updates in the past month:
Dave Morriss
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 7 shows which were without them.
There are currently 377 shows which need a summary and/or tags.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
