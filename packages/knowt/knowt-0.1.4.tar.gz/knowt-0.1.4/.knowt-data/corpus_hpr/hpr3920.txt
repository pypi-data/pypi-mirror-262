## hpr3920 :: RV Trip 2022-2023: Southeast US

 In this episode we look at the planning process for our second RV
trip. Last year we toured the Southwest US, but we don't like to repeat
ourselves. So this time we decided to tour the Southeast US. This not
only let us visit a much different part of the country, but it also
allowed us to go back to our plan to visit some NASA facilities.
