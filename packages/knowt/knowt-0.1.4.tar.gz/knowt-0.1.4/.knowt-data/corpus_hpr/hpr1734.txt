## hpr1734 :: Vim Hints 003

 Moving Around
In this episode I want to look at how you move around the file you are editing in Vim. I also want to add some more elements to the configuration file we started building in the last episode.
Full Notes
Since the notes explaining this subject are long (the size limit is 4000 characters), they have been placed here: https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1734_full_shownotes.html
I usually create my notes with Markdown and pandoc. As an experiment this time I have used a pandoc template which uses the same CSS that provides the style for the main HPR pages. I hope it makes these notes look better than the very bare HTML I have produced in the past.
