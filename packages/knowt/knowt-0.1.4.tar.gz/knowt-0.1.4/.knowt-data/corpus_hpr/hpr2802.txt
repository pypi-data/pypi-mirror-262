## hpr2802 :: Mid-life (?) assessment

 At 40, I’m at the middle of the mean life expectancy in most parts of the world. What’s happened so far, and where do I go from here?
I look at my life’s past in increasingly smaller chunks of years, and then at my life’s future in increasingly larger chunks of years, and speculate about those 80 years — or perhaps many more? — of expected lifetime.
I’m saying mostly the things I wrote at https://loadaverage.org/conversation/10689347 but with some small updates from the last 9 months.
