## hpr0818 :: Sansa Clip Plus for podcasting

 
Long story short is that the Clip+ is pretty great as a cheap all-in-one recording device. I go into a little more detail here, and I have an idea that may make it even better.


Since recording this, I have discovered how to change the recording directory. 


Press the Home button to get to the main menu.
Go to the "Files" option in the main menu, and navigate to the directory (even if it's on the SD card) that you want to use for recording. Highlight it, but don't open it.
Hold down the center button to open a context menu. 
Scroll down and select "Set As Recording Directory".
