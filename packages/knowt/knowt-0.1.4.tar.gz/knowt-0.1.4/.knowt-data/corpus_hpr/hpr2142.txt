 It's been a while since I submitted a show due to time constraints. I was actually feeling pretty bad when I recorded the show, so my voice may not be as loud as usual.
The first book I talk about is "Hacker Culture" by Douglas Thomas

The second book is "A History of Modern Computing" by Paul E. Ceruzzi
https://www.amazon.com/History-Modern-Computing-ebook/dp/0262032554/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1474232397&sr=1-1&keywords=history+of+modern+computing
