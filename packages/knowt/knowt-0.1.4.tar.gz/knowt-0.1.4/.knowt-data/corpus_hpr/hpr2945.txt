An Interview with mystorm.uk makers of the open FPGA. An FPGA chip is a re-programmable piece of silicon hardware, it can be reconfigured or programmed to a logic circuit of your own design.


In 2016 we decided to setup up the myStorm project in order to build OpenSource FPGA hardware. Several years later we are building the 5th generation of BlackIce Development boards. BlackIce Mx the latest generation of our hardware has been built using BlackEdge open hardware standard which enable the 'Core' Board IceCore to be separated from its carrier board which provides MixMod and Pmod hardware add-ons. Please take a look at the myStorm forum to ask questions and participate in our community.
