## hpr1827 :: How I make bread

 Ken Fallon was asking for bread-making advice on a recent Community News recording. I've been making my own bread since the 1970's and I thought I'd share my methods in response. Frank Bell also did an excellent bread-making episode in 2013.
I have prepared a long description of my bread-making process, with photographs and a recipe, and this is all available here: https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1827/full_shownotes.html
