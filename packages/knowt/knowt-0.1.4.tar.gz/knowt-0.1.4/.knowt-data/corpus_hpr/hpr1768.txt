Start to go into the history of C and explain where it came from.
Abstract

C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T 
Bell Labs,[5] and used to (re-)implement the Unix operating system.[6] 
It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all 
time, [7][8] with C compilers from various vendors available for the
majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. 
C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) > since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Explain Types and their meanings

SIGNED: It means it can hold either negative or positive values.
UNSIGNED: Unsigned means it can only hold positive values.

int:

An int is a variable that is at leas 16 bits in size.
It is actually the most efficent for the processor itself.
Capable of storing -32767 -> 32767

Int Specifiers

short: 16 bits in size
short int intThatIsAShort = 0;
long: 32 bits in size
long intThatIsALong = 0; 
long long: 64 bits in size
long long reallyBigInteger = 0;

char

One byte in memory. (8 bits).
Holds a character but can also hold a number
char thisCanHoldALetter = 'x';
char thisCanHoldANumber = 72;

Note about the ascii table

ASCII is just a number corresponding with a letter.
Look here for more information.

float

Holds floating point numbers
float thisIsAFloat = 72.2;

Double

Like a float but bigger.
double thisIsADouble = 0;

Arrays

Arrays are collections of multiple things
Have to be a set size.
Use braces to initalize
If you initalize one you initalize all. 
int arrayOfNums[100] = {0};

Strings

"Strings" are made up of mutliple chars. (Yes it does make sense! :))
char arrayOfChars[81] = {0};
Null termination is added to the end.
'\0'
