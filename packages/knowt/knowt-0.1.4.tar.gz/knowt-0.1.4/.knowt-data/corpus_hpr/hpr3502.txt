## hpr3502 :: New year Greetings and a short review of my new Juno PC

 Hi to all HPR listeners this is a short show just to say Hi and a happy New Year to those in HPR land I may not have talked to over the Mumble marathon (and that is most of you). My main news is my new Juno PC which I got just before Christmas and It is a massive upgrade for me from my old Gen 3 i7 PC I was using. In real world tests it is about 5 times faster than my old PC and editing Audio and images is a breeze. I got the Brutus 5000 with a Ryzen 9 5900 CPU 32Gb RAM and a 1TB Nvme SSD. It came pre loaded with Ubuntu 20.04 but I installed Linux Mint 20.2 and after getting the details of the PPA for the Juno Drivers everything is working fine. Ports wise for a tiny PC it is OK but I have added a USB 3 powered Hub with 4 extra ports and in the new year will get one with a few more to help me tidy up the wiring snakes on the desk.
For some reason it no longer sees any bootable USB drives at boot after pressing of the boot menu key so a bit of investigation is needed to get that to work again, but on the whole I am a happy camper.
Well that's me for this show short as it was if you want more of my ramblings along with my fellow hosts Moss and Dale pop over to Distrohoppers' Digest and see what we have been up to, we record a new show about once a month.
