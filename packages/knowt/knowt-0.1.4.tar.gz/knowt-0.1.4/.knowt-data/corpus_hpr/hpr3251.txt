## hpr3251 :: Opposing Views on Alcohol

 I discuss the subject of alcohol with my partner of sixteen years, Mrs. Honeyhume. While we agree on many subjects, alcohol is not one of them.
She believes alcohol is an important experience, one to be shared with friends, and I dislike nearly everything about it.
We discuss what we like/dislike about alcohol, our histories with it, and present our personal anecdotal evidence.
