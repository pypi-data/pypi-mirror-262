 What's In My Ham Shack
In this episode I am starting what I hope will become a series where Amateur Radio operators talk about what equipment they have and use in their Ham Shacks.
Ham Shack Definition
A good definition of exactly what a Ham Shack is can be found on Wikipedia.

Categories of Ham Radio gear
I tend to divide gear into the following categories.

Portable - hand-held devices designed for carrying.
Mobile - equipment that is designed to be used in a vehicle.
Base - gear used in a fixed station environment.
Miscellaneous - other stuff.
