https://www.reactos.org/

ReactOS® is a free open source operating system based on the best design principles found in the Windows NT® architecture (Windows versions such as Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012 are built on Windows NT architecture). Written completely from scratch, ReactOS is not a Linux based system, and shares none of the UNIX architecture. The main goal of the ReactOS® project is to provide an operating system which is binary compatible with Windows.

Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating file hosting services and using them. It is functionally very similar to the widely used Dropbox, with the primary functional difference being that Nextcloud is free and open-source, and thereby allowing anyone to install and operate it without charge on a private server. In contrast to proprietary services like Dropbox, the open architecture allows adding additional functionality to the server in form of so-called applications.
