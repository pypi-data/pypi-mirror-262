## hpr3498 :: Linux Inlaws S01E45: The Big Xmas New Year bash with the Grumpies

 In this end of year episode / Xmas bumper our two aging heroes host the Grumpy Old Coders
once again. Apart from having lots of fun, our four eclectic panelists discuss the year in
review and some obscure predictions the Inlaws made at the end of last year in S01E20 to
see if these became true or not. Plus a seriously long commercial break on mainframes
done by our own Chris (Arvind / Jim / IBM: If you're listening: the sponsor mail address
is ibm_sponsor@linuxinlaws.eu). Plus some juicy competitive knowledge about some hyperscalers.
Beans spilled right from the inside... In addition to cloud nightmares. So if you're into
horror after never mind beyond Halloween this is your episode... There might be the odd open source
angle to this episode but we are not sure and this of course is purely by accident - just find out for yourself! :-)
