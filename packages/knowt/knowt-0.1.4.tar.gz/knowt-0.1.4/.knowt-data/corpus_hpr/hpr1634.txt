## hpr1634 :: How I got into Linux

 I have been an HPR listener for many years, and I really like the episodes on how people discovered and learn to use Linux. So this is my first HPR contribution. I recorded this on a Sansa Clip on a saturday afternoon. It's not heavily edited, but i did use audacity to remove a few errors I had made. Please excuse the uhhs and umms.
