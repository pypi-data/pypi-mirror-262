## hpr3778 :: A Squirrel Beeing on Google Products and Google Security

 I have a discussion about my Android "WIPING" and how it affected my
2 factor authorization with Google. Further I "beein" some more about
Android not being able to authenticate against a known chromebook using
GOOGLE SECURITY, what a "beeing" , "beeing"!!!!
And I also cover Google's lousy support for chromebooks through
Android, not sharing bandwidth via the cell communication channels. I
cover easytether and ask why Google hasn't given chromebooks the same
bandwidth access any Android phone would have??? WHY???
Google is so piggish and stupid that Android and chromebooks are
almost as if they were separate companies who are in competition with
each other instead of two products from the same company.
I also cover the overbearing Android growth via QR codes and programs
like healio.
