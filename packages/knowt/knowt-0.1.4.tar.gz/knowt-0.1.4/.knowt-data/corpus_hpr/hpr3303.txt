## hpr3303 :: Slackware on RaspberryPi

 a little history

slackware on arm started by stuart winter in 2002
became an official port of slackware in 2009
lots of info at the video podcast on youtube

why choose slackware

can do minimal installs easy
education
stable and secure

who should avoid slackware

unwilling or unable to read and follow directions
if you think your leet when you use apt instead of apt-get
if you think commands like dd are 'scary'

howto

there is no official port of slackware arm to raspberrypi
i think this is because of raspberrypi has a non standard way of booting compared to most arm devices
community has stepped in

on the slackware documentation project website there are 'manual' install projects

took a while, had to download firmware from the raspberrypi project itself
quite a bit of cleanup
this is the guide if you want slackware on a pi-zero

link to the sarpi project

guy named phil project lead, started in 2012
the sarpi project is also a manual process
even if you don't do this you should look at the website content, this is the way to do a tutorial
after you download the sources this install is exactly like any other slackware install
when you get to the package selection its easy to customize

after install

you have a complete development environment
be prepared to up your search foo
many packages can be built from slackbuilds

The only mistakes you can't learn from are, your own fatal mistakes
