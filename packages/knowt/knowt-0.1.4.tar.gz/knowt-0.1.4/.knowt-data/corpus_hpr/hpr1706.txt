## hpr1706 :: Cross-compilers part 1

 
Cross-compilers, Part 1


In this show I'll introduce the concept of cross-compiling software, explain what it
is and why you might want/need to do it.


I'll also talk about a great piece of kit for creating cross-compiler tool-chains
on Linux; crosstool-ng.


As with most of my shows, the show notes are far too long to fit into the restricted size, so there's an HTML version as well, at:

Here are some bullet-points:


cross-compilers, why and what?

crosstool-ng

Cross-compiler tool-chain generation gotchas

Raspberry Pi cross-compiling tool-chain generation with crosstool-ng

Compiling a kernel on a Pi takes 15 hours

On my not-so-screaming quad-core Debian machine it takes 15 minutes

There are a few files for this show, the ct-ng .config files downloaded from Arch Linux ARM and a README.md about them. The original
markdown source of the full show notes is in the tarball as well https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1706/282-Mike_Ray-hpr1706-Cross-compilers_Part_1.tar.gz.
