The Surface Pro X is a 2-in-1 detachable tablet computer developed by Microsoft. It was developed alongside and was announced on 2 October 2019 alongside the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3.[1] Updated hardware was announced alongside Surface Laptop Go and Surface accessories on October 1, 2020[2] and September 22, 2021.[3] The device starts at $899.99 USD / Â£849.99.[4][5]
The Surface Pro X comes with a Microsoft SQ1 or SQ2 ARM processor, which the company claimed has three times the performance of an x86 MacBook Air, whilst also having a 13-hour battery life. This is due to the increased power efficiency of ARM processors compared to traditional x86 processors.[1][6][7] Microsoft has previously used ARM processors in the discontinued Surface RT and Windows Phone devices.
Microsoft now offers a Wifi-only version of the device as announced at their Surface Event on September 22, 2021.[8]
