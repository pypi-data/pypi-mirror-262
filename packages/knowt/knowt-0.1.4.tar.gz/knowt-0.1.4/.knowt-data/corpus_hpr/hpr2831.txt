## hpr2831 :: Interview with Robbie Ferguson

 When it comes to monitoring your network, and the machines on it, you have a lot of options. But, let’s face it : none of those are easy to implement, and configuring a monitoring tool, whether it’s an open-source or a proprietary one, is often complex and time consuming.
Well, someone took that matter into their own hands, and made NEMS. What is NEMS, how can it help us, and what infrastructure does it require? Those are a few of the questions I asked Robbie Ferguson, the maintainer of NEMS, who joined me on Easter week-end for a little chat.
