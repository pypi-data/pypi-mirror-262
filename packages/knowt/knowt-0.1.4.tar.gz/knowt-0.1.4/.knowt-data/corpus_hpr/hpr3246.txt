## hpr3246 :: LXCast: freeing the Fairphone 3 (and many other phones) 

 
My review on the FP3 when it came out

Two solutions for a free OS:

lineage OS - free android with the Gapps removed
https://download.lineageos.org/FP3
the /e/ project !! A "de-googled" operating system - actually a fork of lineage OS - this is what I'm going to talk about here.

The research paper on Google Data Collection by Professor Douglas C. Schmidt, Vanderbilt University (2018) - learn how and how often normal Android phones send your data to Google servers.

Another background article on tracking (in German) based on research from a Norwegian journalist:

MicroG services, a replacement for Google's libraries on /e/ with purely open-source implementations.
The man behind the /e/ project: Gael Duval, pioneer of Open Source, Mandrake, Ulteo...

You can buy a FP3 and an FP3 + with /e/ pre-installed here !!

How to install it on the FP3

Install /e/ on FairPhone FP3 - FP3 | /e/ documentation
Privacy ratings of apps: https://exodus-privacy.eu
Alternative launchers:

KISS launcher
Simple launcher

I recommended you add these apps:

Antennapod - podcast client
FairEmail or simple email
Fennec (Firefox)
Signal
newpipe for watching youtube without being tracked

Backup via adb is apparently broken | Not the fault of /e/!!
You cannot simply flash a new recovery, such as TWRP, to flash images or backup, instead, you can use this method
