## hpr0968 :: FFMPEG for video Conversion

 Hello Hacker Public Radio
BrocktonBob here with my tutorial on how I use FFMPEG to convert videos to any format I like.
FFMPEG is a terminal program used in Linux, but Windows and Mac users can use WINFF which
is the gui frontend for FFMPEG.
FFMPEG is more powerful than WINFF because you have more control when you use the terminal than a gui. Below are the examples I used in this podcast.
I hope you give it a try

My Examples:

ffmpeg -i glue.flv glue.avi
ffmpeg -i glue.flv glue.mp3
ffmpeg -i glue.flv -target ntsc-dvd output.mpg
