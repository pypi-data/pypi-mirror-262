## hpr3447 :: BlacKernel's Journey Into Technology: Episode 2

 Talking Points

W*ndows Power User
	
Programmed a few Visual BASIC programs, but was underwhelmed with how BASIC the programming language was
Tried installing Python and Ruby to much frustration
Tried installing Cygw*n to make Python/Ruby easier to work with
Read on the Cygw*n site about something called Linux
Started working with C and C++

Customizing my deck
	
Tried to customize as much as I could about my W*ndows install
Utilized tools to change the boot logo, the start menu, the init scripts, etc.
Hit a few snags with problems boot-looping, not loading graphically, etc
Tried editing the W*ndows registry and realized that the programs I was using to edit the operating system necessarily break the security and stability of the OS
Didn't really know/care about open source, but was getting frustrated that I wasn't able to just reach in to my system's code to fix it.

I couldn't really find any of the stuff that I used and, at this point, I'm not super motivated to find them.
