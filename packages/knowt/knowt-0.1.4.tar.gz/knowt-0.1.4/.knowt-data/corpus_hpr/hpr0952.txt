## hpr0952 :: How I cut The Cable Cord Part 2

 
Hello HPR,
Just BrocktonBob here again with part 2 of How I Cut The Cable Cord.
In this episode I talk about adding a second set top box, and getting the
Playon Server software on a computer so you can get a lot more content. I also
talk to you about adding an external harddrive. And how I made my own HD tv
antenna.
