## hpr2154 :: Replacing a Bicycle Brake Cable

 Part of my series of fixing stuff and wearing a microphone while I do it, listen along as I replace the brake cable and housing on my bicycle. For information about the tools I'm using, check out my earlier episode about the tools in my bicycle repair toolbox. Check the Flickr photo album below for pictures to go along with the narrative. Sorry I kept sniffling so much. Allergies were terrible. The church bells in the background are from Our Lady of Fatima Church, which is nearby. I remember Dave wondered about the church bells from a previous episode.
