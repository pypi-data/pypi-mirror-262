## hpr1369 :: NaNoWriMo Prep

 
I was prepping for National November Writing month (NaNoWriMo), and realized that I hadn't contributed a show in several years. I thought I would give a rundown on what NaNoWriMo is and what tools I use to write with. NaNoWriMo is where people get together to each write a 50,000 word novel rough draft in 30 days. It's not an easy task, and there are some tricks and tools that will help. My focus is on minimalism.
