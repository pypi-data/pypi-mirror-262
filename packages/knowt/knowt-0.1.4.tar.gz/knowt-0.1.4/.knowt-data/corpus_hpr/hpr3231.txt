## hpr3231 :: USB Key

 Script and instruction at
https://james.toebesacademy.com/USBKey.html

Combo of

Perl for Installation,
ssh-keygen for key exchange.
udev for actions
bash for locking/unlocking/key checking.




udev add/remove/change events

add event does not allow access to drive
change event was not allowing unlock.


Compromise was unlock, then lock if key check fails.
