## hpr2304 :: Using Gnome 3 for the First Time

 Here are the three Gnome 3 extensions I am enjoying:

Clipboard indicator at https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/
Dynamic top bar at https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/885/dynamic-top-bar/
Removable drive menu at https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7/removable-drive-menu/
