## hpr1288 :: Nido Media gets Ken to go camping at OHM2013

 
Slowly but surely over the almost 15 years of his stay in the Netherlands, Ken has been Dutchified. He's got a bakfiets, he learned the language(ish), he has a pair of wooden shoes, he even eats mayonnaise with his fries. But one thing he has rebelled against is camping (ok also Steak Tartare aka 'American Fillet' aka raw cow). That most Dutch of traditions, where the family head off to some deserted field, be it by the sea, in a forest, or on the polder, one thing is sure, it will be damp, wet, mosquito ridden, dark too late and bright too early, and wet - optionally cold and hot. In short hell. Of course that's his personal opinion. 


Of course, Nido Media sees it as a relaxing vacation away from the hustle and bustle of a busy life, fortified with happy memories where he and his family enjoyed the long summer days when it never rained and they were allowed to stay up late.


So how can these two dividing opinions be bridged ?


In short: Fiber to the Tent. https://ohm2013.org/site/
