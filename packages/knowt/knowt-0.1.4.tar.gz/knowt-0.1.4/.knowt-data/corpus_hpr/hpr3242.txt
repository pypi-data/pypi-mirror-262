## hpr3242 :: The eternal battle over how to run your chromebook is about to begin

 As usual, I have botched up the show notes where they make absolutely no sense and I fully expect the ENTIRE HUMAN COMMUNITY from HPR to attack me endlessly over my incompetence. They just keep forgetting that I'm a squirrel who lives in a magical forrest and not a human being and therefore does terrible show notes,
There were so many issues brought up about chromebooks and chromiumOS that I could not prepare a detailed list of them all.
This ENTIRE conversation was derived from the work found on GNU WORLD ORDER episode 383 for which you will find his show notes AS::: https://gnuworldorder.info/ "Linux, Flatpaks, Android apps, and ChromiumOS on a Lenovo Chromebook."
Now, if you don't like my show notes and you do like this aliens show notes, then may I suggest your anti-squirrel and you need to be sent to a de-programming camp for rehabilitation.
Remember, squirrels represent planet earth.
