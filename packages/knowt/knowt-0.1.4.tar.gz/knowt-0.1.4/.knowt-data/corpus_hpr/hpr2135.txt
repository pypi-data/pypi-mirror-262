## hpr2135 :: Audio speedup script

 Audio speedup script
Back in 2015 Ken Fallon did a show (episode 1766) on how to use sox to truncate silence and speed up audio.
Inspired by this I wrote a Bash script to aid my use of the technique, which I thought I’d share with you.
I have written out detailed notes for this episode describing the script and examining how it works and these are available here https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr2135/full_shownotes.html.
