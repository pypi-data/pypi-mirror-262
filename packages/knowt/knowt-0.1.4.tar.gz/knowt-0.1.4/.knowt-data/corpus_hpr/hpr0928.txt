The proprietary software device that does not allow printing or saving
information without "key" was called "Design Key" or "Software Dongle" by
myself. This is the brand "we used" (were provided) by design software (CAD
type) kitchen and bathroom design program. (This is the "dongle" device. I do
not care if I mention the proprietary software name. It's not very good and
it's . . . well, proprietary.)
