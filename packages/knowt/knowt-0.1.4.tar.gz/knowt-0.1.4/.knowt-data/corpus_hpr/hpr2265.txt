## hpr2265 :: WattOS on Lenovo X61s

 This is a follow on show from the one about WattOS on the Acer AspireOne I did recently.
I talk about installing and running of the OS on this 10+ year old laptop and how they are still a viable option as a cheap laptop.
Note all the recording, and uploading to HPR of this episode was done on the X61s
