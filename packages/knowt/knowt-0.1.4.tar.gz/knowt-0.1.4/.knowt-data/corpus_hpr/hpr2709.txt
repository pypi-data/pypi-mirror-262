## hpr2709 :: Bash Tips - 16

 Bash Tips - 16 (Further auxiliary Bash tips)
Arrays in Bash
This is the first of a small group of shows on the subject of arrays in Bash. It is also the sixteenth show in the Bash Tips sub-series.
We have encountered Bash arrays at various points throughout this sub-series, and have even seen a number of examples, but the subject has never been examined in detail. This group of shows intends to make good this deficiency.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
