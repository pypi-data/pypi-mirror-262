Audio Book Club - planning the next recordings, the Mumble change and the location of the feeds
A slight misunderstanding about Orca arising from the Community News
Some discussion about the generation of audio and HTML show notes
Should we publish the HPR downloads stats ? - continuation of last month's discussion with the conclusion that yes, we should publish these stats
