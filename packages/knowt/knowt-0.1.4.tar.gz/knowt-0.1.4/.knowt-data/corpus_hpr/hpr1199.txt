## hpr1199 :: Old Time Radio on the web

 
Frank Bell talks about Old Time Radio (OTR), his history as a radio listener, and his Old Time Radio websites.


The OTR Fans site defines OTR as "Old time radio often called "OTR" refers to radio shows from the early days of radio broadcasting. The term usually applies to dramas, comedies, mystery shows, westerns and variety shows that were acted out by professional actors and sent out over the airwaves. In the golden age of radio families would sit around their radio listening to the exciting shows the way we sit around our television sets watching them today."
