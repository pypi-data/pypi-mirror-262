## hpr3494 :: Recent Generator Repairs and Maintenance

 In this episode I talk about some work I've done recently on my Generac 4000xl portable generator. Here are some images to accompany the episode. First a beefcake shot of the unit:

Here's the receptacle for the fat cable with a 4-prong plug. This goes right into my main electrical panel.

Here's the interlock switch on my panel, which allows you to plug the generator into your panel safely.
