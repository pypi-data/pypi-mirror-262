## hpr1466 :: Thoughts on GPS

 
I've always liked maps. Since getting a few GPS enabled devices maps have become even more useful to me, and I like them more and more all the time. Here is a brief episode on the GPS devices and map software that I use most often. I hope you enjoy my episode, and find something useful in it. The outro is a remix of Downright by Broam and Klaatu.
