Interview with Dr. Jeffrey Welser

VP of Exploratory Science at IBM Research
IBM Release first 2nm chip this year

Engineers vs Scientists and how they drive innovations
Goal to replace the transistor when Moore's Law stops scaling
Managing thermal loads
Finding new structures and materials to control current
Neural nets, image recognition and AI
Quantum computing

qubits

superposition state
"Spooky action at a distance"

Encryption

Need millions of qubits to break current encryption

Only currently over 100 qubits
At least a decade from having enough qubits
Currently have classical systems that cannot be broken by quantum computers

The math does not map onto a quantum system
Currently working with NIST to create quantum safe cryptography
