The Northeast GNU/Linux Fest is an advocate of Free software. We hope to bring
awareness of Free software to college students their schools, programmers and
businesses. We welcome everyone from the new user to the people that have been
there from the beginning. Come and learn how Free software can affect
accessibility and your business, graphic design, software security and
performance along with stability. So lets take back control of our computers
and gadets and learn about software Freedom and The 4 Freedoms we should be
concerned about. Come to the Northeast GNU/Linux Fest to learn, teach and talk
about Free software and join the Free software revolution.
