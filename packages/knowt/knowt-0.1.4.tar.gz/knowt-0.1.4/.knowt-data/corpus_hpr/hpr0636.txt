 An id3 tag is meta-data attached to an audio file, and is (ideally) about the file to which it is attached. If you've ever tried to edit id3 tags through a media player, then you know what a pain that is. If you haven't... Well, now you never have to. Rejoice! Kid3-qt is an id3 tag editor, and it is awesome.
