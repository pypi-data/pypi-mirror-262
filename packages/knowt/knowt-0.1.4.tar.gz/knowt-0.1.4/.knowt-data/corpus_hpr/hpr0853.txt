## hpr0853 :: Pat Volkerding of Slackware Linux chats with Klaatu

 Pat Volkerding of Slackware Linux chats with Klaatu and whomever happens to wander by (Maco, Vincent Batts, Chad Wallenberg, and others) at the SELF afterparty.

Slackware
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Slackware is a free and open source Linux-based operating system. It was one of the earliest operating systems to be built on top of the Linux kernel and is the oldest currently being maintained. Slackware was created by Patrick Volkerding of Slackware Linux, Inc. in 1993. The current stable version is 13.37, released on April 27, 2011.
Slackware aims for design stability and simplicity, and to be the most "Unix-like" Linux distribution, making as few modifications as possible to software packages from upstream and using plain text files and a small set of shell scripts for configuration and administration.




Warning: this is not a proper interview, just 40 minutes of aimless and fairly noisy chit chat at a party.
So it's probably not for everyone, although if you're a Slackware fan then it might be of some interest.
