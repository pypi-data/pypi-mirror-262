## hpr2078 :: What's in my bag?

 If you should happen to find me on the road, don’t kill me! I’m an atheist!
Also, this will be the contents of my bag:

Stainless steel coffee mug, Stewarts-branded
Stanley stainless steel thermos
Kleen kanteen wide, 40oz stainless steel water bottle
1½-foot micro USB cable
Ethernet cable (currently retractable)
Sony headphones
Handful of SD and USB storage, including 64GB primary on keychain
Maglite AA-powered flashlight
Ballpoint pen
Lunch, usually in a mason jar or metal box
If it’s Wednesday or Thursday, my backup drive
Dell Mini 9 with AC adapter
If I’m walking to the Tech Center, a ZaReason Verix laptop with AC adapter
