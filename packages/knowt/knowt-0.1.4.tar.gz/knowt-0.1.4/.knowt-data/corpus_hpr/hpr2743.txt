## hpr2743 :: Character build in the d20 system

 Klaatu and Lostnbronx spend an hour building an RPG character at a leisurely, and hopefully informative, pace. While the build process here is technically specific to the sci-fi (or science fantasy, really) game Starfinder, the idea is to convey the generic process of stepping through a character build instruction, cross-referencing important rules, and generally learning how to build a character in an unfamiliar system.
