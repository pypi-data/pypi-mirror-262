Why install from linux

Most VPS providers have images for linux, but not OpenBSD
Easier than trying to upload custom image or iso.

Grub2

Start with a distro that uses grub2. I use Centos7
grub2 can load OpenBSD kernels.
The openbsd installer is a OpenBSD kernel.

Procedure

Make sure you have console access to the linux VM
Record the Network info for the running linux VM. If not using DHCP, you will need to know the IP, netmask, default route (gateway), and a DNS server.
Download the OpenBSD installation ram disk to /boot
cd /boot
wget https://ftp5.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.0/amd64/bsd.rd
Reboot
Enter the grub command prompt by pressing c at the grub menu
The grub2 prompt has tab completion which can be helpful.
Type ls to see the available disks
Load the OpenBSD installation ram disk and boot
grub> set root=(hd0,msdos1)
grub> kopenbsd /bsd.rd
grub> boot

The Installation

The Installer will ask you several questions
The default is almost always what you want. If unsure, just press enter.
Look at the FAQ if you get stuck
Enter the network settings of the linux VPS
When asked "Location of sets", use HTTP
