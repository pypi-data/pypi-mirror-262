 Glasgow Podcrawl 2016
Kevie and Dave Morriss chat about the upcoming Glasgow Podcrawl. This year's event takes place on the 29th of July 2016 and kicks off at 6pm in the State Bar, Holland Street.
The event is open to anybody with an interest in podcasting, open source software or creative commons music. Whether you're an enthusiast or just interested in finding out more, also if you're a member of a band, then we would love to have you along for a yarn over a few pints.
