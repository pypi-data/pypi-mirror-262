## hpr2262 :: Abstracting Nurse Jesus

 NOTE: the audio recording appears to have periodic jitter. As I recorded at 44.1 Khz this time, I wonder if my S2 just handles recording at a lower quality better, and if so I'll prefer lower quality over jitter in the recording.
In this episode I explain why and how I abstracted random number and choice generation into self-sustainable methods for objects.

A superclass was needed so that all the classes of object in the game engine would have access to these random generation methods.
I preferred to use methods in this case so objects would be self-sufficient and wouldn't depend on extra modules imported at the top of my code.
The syntactic sugar achieved by using customized methods instead of i.e. random.randint(0, 99) makes the code easier to write and understand at a glance.
Nurse Jesus is a pun on the acronym RNG for Random Number Generator
Let me know if you get the reference at 2:00 ;-)

I recorded this episode in parts using a program called Urecord on my pocket computer (mobile phone).
I program using Pygame, post on a GNU Social account, and maintain a personal website at NoxBanners.NET. I study programming techniques at Refactoring.com, style at Python.org, and sometimes patterns at Portland Pattern Repository
