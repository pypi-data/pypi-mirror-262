## hpr2452 :: Hydraulic Heavy Scale Project

 Hydraulic Heavy Scale Project
by David Whitman
Why? - to weigh a heavy object yourself
Not very difficult. Can be done in about 1/2 hour by someone who has experience doing this type of stuff. Lots longer for beginners.
Things you will need: A drill motor, The right size bit for a small pilot hole and the right size bit for a fitting to connect the jack cylinder to the pressure gauge, A Thread TAP to make threads to connect the hydraulic 90 degree fitting to the jack, Some pipe dope is not a bad idea, A 90 degree appropriately sized fitting to connect a pressure gauge to the jack, a vise is nice, a wrench to dismantle the jack, A way to accurately measure the cylinder bore (best is a caliper) and some oil to refill the jack.
