## hpr1584 :: An interview with Josh Knapp from AnHonestHost.com

 
For years our own Josh Knapp has been the real Server Administrator behind Hacker Public Radio, and has been subsidising it out of his own pocket for some time.


He and a few of his colleagues have decided to branch off and set up their own company. AnHonestHost.com is based on a simple idea; Better web hosting that's honest and fair.


We discuss the past, the future and how it affects HPR.
