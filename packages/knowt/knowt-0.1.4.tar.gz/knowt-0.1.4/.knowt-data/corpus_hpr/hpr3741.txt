Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2022-November/thread.html
Events Calendar
With the kind permission of LWN.net we are linking to
The LWN.net Community Calendar.
Quoting the site:
This is the LWN.net community event calendar, where we track
events of interest to people using and developing Linux and free software.

HPR RSS feeds and https
links
A question came up in November regarding the HPR RSS feeds. All of
the URLs in these feeds use 'http' as opposed to
'https'.
Although this may seem odd, this is a fairly common thing to do,
because the RSS standard (such as it is) does not cater for
'https' links. There is a concern that passing an RSS feed
with such links to a validator (such as the W3C Feed Validation Service)
will result in it being marked as invalid.
Older HPR shows on
archive.org, phase 2
Now that all shows from number 1 to the latest have been uploaded to
the Internet Archive there are other tasks to perform. We are
reprocessing and re-uploading shows in the range 871 to 2429 as
explained in the Community News show notes released in May
2022. We are keeping a running total here to show progress:
