## hpr1081 :: Preparing Pictures for Posting with the GIMP

 Frank Bell describes the process he uses to prepare photographs for posting pictures on his website.  The goal of the process is not to transform the pictures, but to enhance them, and includes sharpening, adjusting the contrast and brightness, cropping, and resizing.  Frank walks through applying the process to a snapshot from his deck garden.
