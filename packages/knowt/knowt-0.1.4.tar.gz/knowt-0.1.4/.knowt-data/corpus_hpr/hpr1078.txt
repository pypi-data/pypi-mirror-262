## hpr1078 :: A podcast about software patents/unitary patent

 In today's show we hear from the executive director of April, the main French association devoted to promoting and protecting Free Software.

In the next few days, the legal affairs (JURI) Committee of the European Parliament will discuss on the next actions regarding the project for a unitary patent. Behind what looks like a technical text lies a crucial issue: who decides on what is patentable and what is not.

As software patents are coming back in international news with the Apple/Samsung case, we need to ensure that such aberrations cannot happen in Europe. We calls for a general mobilisation to contact all MEPs, so that the European Parliament finally tackles the issue of the software patentability.

April has put into place a few campaigning tools to inform and to raise MEPs' awareness. Everything is available on :
