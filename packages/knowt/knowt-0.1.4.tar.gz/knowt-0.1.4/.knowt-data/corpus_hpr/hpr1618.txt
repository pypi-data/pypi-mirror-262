## hpr1618 :: OggCamp Attendees

 
This show includes two interviews with OggCamp attendees this year. 


The first interview is with TDTRS co-host Peter Cannon, who is convinced that his podcast is the best Linux podcast there is and he is sure going to tell you why.

In the second interview I talked to Alistair (whose name I hopefully spell correctly), who told me that he would like to be a HPR host himself. So this ist his first appearance on HPR and hopefully not the last.
