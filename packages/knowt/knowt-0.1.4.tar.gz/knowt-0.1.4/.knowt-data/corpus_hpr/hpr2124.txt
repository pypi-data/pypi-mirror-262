## hpr2124 :: Repairing a Cloth Shopping Bag with a Sewing Machine

 In this episode I repair one of the straps/handles of a cloth shopping bag. I talk about using a sewing machine, about those dreadful bobbins, and about sewing a Halloween costume one time. I actually cut out about four or five minutes of near silence from when I was trying to get the thread to go through the needle. That's getting much harder to do as I get older. See the Pictures too.
