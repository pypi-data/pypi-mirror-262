## hpr1192 :: LiTS 024: time and /usr/bin/time

 The time program is a handy tool to not only gauge how much time in seconds it takes a program to run, but will also display how much user CPU time and system CPU time was used to execute the process. To understand these values you must grasp how the kernel handles the time reporting for the process. For example, the output of:
time ls
is
real 0m0.007s
user 0m0.000s
sys 0m0.003s
