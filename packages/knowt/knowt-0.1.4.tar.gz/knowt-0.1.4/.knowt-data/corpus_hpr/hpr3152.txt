## hpr3152 :: My Pocket Knives

 Introduction
As a boy I was allowed to have a penknife from about the age of 10. Since then I have tended to carry pocket knives with me on a regular basis.
I have three knives that often travel with me, though two might have become illegal in the UK in the recent past because they lock.
The knives are:

Victorinox Huntsman
Durol locking knife
Roxon KS-S501

Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
