## hpr1399 :: Interview with Ben Everard https://www.linuxvoice.com 

 In this show I interview Ben Everard, former editor of Linux Format who is now promoting a crowd-funded campaign through Indiegogo for a new Linux magazine, Linux Voice. We also talk about Ben's other project which is a book called "Learning Python with Raspberry Pi" from Wiley Publishing. Later in the podcast we talk about how Ben arrived to Linux and what he finds to be the most exciting thing he has written about as well as what's going on in the Linux world.
