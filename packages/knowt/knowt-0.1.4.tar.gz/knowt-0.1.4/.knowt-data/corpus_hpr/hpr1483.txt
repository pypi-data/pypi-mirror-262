Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and contributors. The discussions are open and available on the Gmane archive.


Discussed this month was:

Backup Shows

In a discussion started by Dave Morris. Some felt that the content was getting stale, and keeping shows for 2 years or even 3 months was too long. Others felt that these shows were contributed with the purpose of been used in an emergency and therefore should be timeless.
Eventually it was left to each of the contributors that had shows in the backup queue to release them, or to set them as emergency shows. The website has been updated to reflect this change.
