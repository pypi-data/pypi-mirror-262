First change
# LILO configuration file
# Append any additional kernel parameters:
append="acpi=ht"
Dropped CPU usage to 50%
Second change
grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/

/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe1D:322734808     STS enabled      unmasked

echo "mask" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpeXX
Interrupts
Interrupts
 
My case was
echo "mask" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe1D
Dropped usage to 0-5%
Then added the mask to crontab -e under root
Add 'acpi_mask_gpe=0x1D' or whatever interrupt corresponds to the overactive one, and remember to run the lilo command afterward to make the kernel option active.
