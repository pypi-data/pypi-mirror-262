## hpr3466 :: Why HPR has less downloads

 I did a show about why I do not listen to non-mainstream podcasts as much as I used to. For me two things happened: I switched from being in the car for 16 hours a week to being a remote sales person at home. So the 16 hours I listened to podcasts every week in the car went away. The second reason I reduced was that many of the podcasts I was listening to were presented by people who do not share my values. So I stopped listening to them. The third reason I listen less is the Army opened up the online book library to retired service members and I do a lot of audio books in the moment.
