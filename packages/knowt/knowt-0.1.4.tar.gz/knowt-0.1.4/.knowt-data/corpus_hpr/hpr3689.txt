## hpr3689 :: Linux Inlaws S01E65: TerminusDB

 As part of the effort of turning the planet's premier Rust marketing podcast into a full-blown NoSQL show, in this episode Chris hosts some of the key people behind a NoSQL database called TerminusDB (Martin couldn't make it as he was firing, um, re-organising the Inlaw's marketing department once again). Luke (the CEO) and Gavin (CTO) of TerminusDB spill the beans on the history of the project, ontologies and why they still matter not only in a mobile-first world and why a website called DB Engines simply doesn't do the trick (putting it very diplomatically). Never mind the road ahead... (including quantum AI and some other fancy stuff - you heard it here first!). And also next week's lotto numbers (perhaps).
