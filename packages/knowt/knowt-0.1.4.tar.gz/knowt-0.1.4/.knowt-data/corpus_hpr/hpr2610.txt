## hpr2610 :: Gnu Awk - Part 12

 Gnu Awk - Part 12
Introduction
This is the twelfth episode of the “Learning Awk” series which is being produced by b-yeezi and myself.
In this episode I want to continue with the subject I started in episode 10, an advanced-level look at arrays in Awk. This episode covers patsplit which can split a string into an array, the built-in array PROCINFO which can be used to control how awk sorts arrays, as well as asort and asorti, built-in functions for sorting arrays.
In case it might be of interest I have also included a section describing a recent use I made of awk to solve a problem.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
