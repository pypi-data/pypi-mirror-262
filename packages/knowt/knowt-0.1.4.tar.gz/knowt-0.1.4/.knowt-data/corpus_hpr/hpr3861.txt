## hpr3861 :: How To find Things on your home Network

 Hey guys I lost my Raspberry Pi Zero W - its place in the house. I am
not sure if it's on solar power running or not. But in in any case it's
not out and about at the normal locations in my home for such items.
So I use an App called Network Analyzer on my Huawei phone to find
the IPs in use in the home.
Then use putty go and see how the PI is doing.
Enjoy the Show
