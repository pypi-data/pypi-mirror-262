## hpr3890 :: Lessons Learned

 This trip started with a difficult week with things breaking and
mistakes being made. But in the end we had a really good time and want
to do another trip. But we have learned a few lessons, and we'll pass
them along to benefit anyone else who might want to do something
similar.
