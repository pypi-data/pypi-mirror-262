## hpr2975 :: SimpleScreenRecorder and Vidcutter

 In today’s show Ken talks about two small applications to make recording and trimming video easy.
What is SimpleScreenRecorder?

SimpleScreenRecorder is a Linux program that I’ve created to record programs and games. There were already a few programs that could do this, but I wasn’t 100% happy with any of them, so I created my own.
My original goal was to create a program that was just really simple to use, but as I was writing it I started adding more and more features, and the result is actually a pretty powerful program. It’s ‘simple’ in the sense that it’s easier to use than ffmpeg/avconv or VLC, because it has a straightforward user interface.

What is VidCutter

The simplest & sexiest tool for cutting and joining your videos without the need for re-encoding or a diploma in multimedia. VidCutter focuses on getting the job done using tried and true tech in its arsenal via mpv and FFmpeg.
