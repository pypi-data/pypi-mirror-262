Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2022-March/thread.html

Access problems from Argentina
An HPR listener from Argentina reports that the HPR site is unavailable from there. This applies both to an ISP connection and on a mobile phone. It's not clear what is causing this.
Reportedly the problem was resolved on March 30th but the next day it returned and at the time of writing the HPR site is still unavailable.
Older HPR shows on archive.org
As reported on the last Community News all shows in the range 1-870 had been uploaded except for shows hpr0001 - hpr0003. Shows hpr0001 and hpr0002 had been "blocked" by existing non-HPR items from over 8 years ago, with the names we were going to assign. Show hpr0003 seemed to have been an early attempt to upload blocks of shows since it contained the audio for shows 1-9, but no notes.
We received help with clearing the slots for shows 1 and 2 from Jason Scott of the Internet Archive, and the correct shows have now been uploaded. Show hpr0003 has now been resolved by replacing the contents with the appropriate transcoded audio and the notes have been added to it.
We can now consider this project to be complete!
