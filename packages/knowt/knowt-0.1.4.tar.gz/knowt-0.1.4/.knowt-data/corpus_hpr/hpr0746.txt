## hpr0746 :: Interview with Tony Whitmore about OggCamp11

 
In todays episode Ken interviews Tony Whitmore of the Ubuntu-UK Podcastabout OggCamp11.
OggCamp 11 is a two-day technology festival
bringing together the most interesting people from the Linux, Open
Source and Hardware Hacking communities to share their passion and
knowledge on all things geeky in a barcamp-style atmosphere.
Taking place AUGUST 13 & 14, FARNHAM MALTINGS, UK

OggCamp 11 is a two-day unconference where technology enthusiasts come
together to exchange knowledge on a wide range of topics from Linux
and open source software to building home automation systems. Now in
its third year, the event is steadily growing and attracting
interesting speakers from all over the UK, the rest of Europe and even
the US. Since OggCamp is an unconference, speaking schedules are set
on the first day and everyone is free to propose a talk themselves.
You are of course free to come along and just listen to other people's
talks but we strongly encourage everyone to take part and talk on
something they are passionate about in technology. OggCamp was first
organised by the combined forces of the Linux Outlaws and the Ubuntu UK Podcast as a filler
event after the last
LugRadio Live was decided to be a one-day only event.
