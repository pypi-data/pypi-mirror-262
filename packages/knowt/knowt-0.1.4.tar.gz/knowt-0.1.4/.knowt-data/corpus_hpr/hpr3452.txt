## hpr3452 :: Neuton battery test

 Introduction
On today's show I test whether the battery replacement for my Neuton mower is a success. This is a follow up to episode 3443. After some audio recording difficulties with the blue tooth headset I used with my phone, we hear if the replacement was successful. Before I could test the battery, I needed to replace the mower key. I think it would have been simple to just jump the terminals with a wire and maybe some alligator clips to hold the wire to the key terminals, but I was worried this would not guarantee the wire shaking loose as I moved. I looked on EBay and found a replacement key for about fifteen dollars US, and decided it was worth the cost and the wait before trying out the mower.
Testing the mower
After putting the key in the mower, pulling and holding the safety levers, and then pressing the start button. The mower wouldn't start. I checked the key was set properly, and saw the green LED on the handle lit and indicating that power was available. I pulled the key and battery out, and then reseated both of them, checking once again that the power indicator was lit. After some fooling around with the safety levers and start button, I realized you had to push the start button and then pull and hold the safety levers for the mower to start. The mower runs well, and the cost of the batteries and key will even out over time from the savings on not paying for a lawn service.
