## hpr2704 :: Intro to Scribus

 Scribus is a page layout application. If you are familiar with common publishing industry tools, then Scribus will be very familiar to you, but if you're used to word processors or graphic applications, then Scribus will probably confuse you. In this episode, Klaatu talks about the workflow of page layout, and how to do some basic tasks in Scribus.
