2013-14 New Years 24-hour show
Hello All,
 We are roughly around 10 weeks away from the next 24-hour New Year's show. This a call out for all parties who are interested in helping with this year's show. We mainly need to make arrangements for a Mumble server and a few streaming servers. If you have any of these resources available then please send me your name, email address, available resources, and a day/time that is convenient for you to meet on-line on a Mumble server for organizational purposes.
 Thank you,
 Kwisher on IRC kevin dot wisher at gmail dot com
