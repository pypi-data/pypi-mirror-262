## hpr1567 :: Multiboot Partitioning with Linux

 I like to distro-hop some and try out new things. Sometimes, I want to have 2 or more Linux distros on my system at the same time so I can compare and contrast them. Initially I used a separate /home and mounted it to each distro on my system. This led to config file corruption and I needed a new approach. I hope this will help somebody!
