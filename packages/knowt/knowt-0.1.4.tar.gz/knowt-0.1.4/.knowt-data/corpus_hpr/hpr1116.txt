## hpr1116 :: Interview with Richard Stallman

 
Holy cow! I just interviewed RMS! Check it out.


I tried to conduct a friendly interview with Richard here. Every time I've heard him interviewed before, it's been pretty hostile, and I didn't want that. That doesn't mean that I only asked him softball questions, but I didn't get in his face about anything, and I gave him the time he needed to explain his answers fully. I hope I did a good job of making Mr. Stallman feel welcome at Hacker Public radio, and I hope the interview is as enjoyable to listen to as it was to record. His views on Free Software are pretty well known, so I tried to cover some things that I've never heard Richard's opinoins on as well. I KNOW... I missed some pretty obvious followup questions. I realized most of them while editing. I'm sorry. The good news is that RMS is pretty accessable, and you can probably get him to do a followup interview that we'll publish right here on hackerpublicradio.org .

I want to thank the following people who helped in the production of this episode:
Richard for the interview itself. It was a real pleasure. I hope we can do it again sometime.
Martin Dluhos, Richard's assistant, for setting up mumble on an FSF computer, and handeling the scheduling, etc... 
irc.freenode.net #oggcastplanet for all of the great questions and inspiration. You guys rock (as always)! I wish I had thought to write down who each question belonged to. Sorry about that.
Door-to-door-geek, and the Linux Basix podcast for the use of their mumble server.
Neil Dudeman and the other guys who listened live for the support and some more great questions.
Broam (a.k.a. Brian, NOT Bryan with a why) for being a good friend, and trying to get home in time to co-host. Happy Birthday, buddy.

Some people enjoy finding mistakes. For their enjoyment (and because I was up 'til 3:00 am finishing this) I have included a few.
