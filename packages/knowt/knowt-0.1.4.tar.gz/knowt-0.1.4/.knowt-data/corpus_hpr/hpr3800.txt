## hpr3800 :: NIST Quantum Cryptography Update 20221008

 The process NIST initiated in 2016 continues as it looks for
encryption algorithms that will be secure against the anticipated
arrival of practical quantum computing. In this update I report on the
first 4 Candidates to be Standardized, and the timeline for completion.
It is coming faster than you may have realized.
