## hpr1842 :: TiT Radio 20 You've Been Pwned (probably)

 
Longtime listeners of Hacker Public Radio will remember 'TiT Radio', a semi-weekly FOSS "news" and commentary show that appeared on HPR, recorded by the cast of "Linux Cranks" on the off schedule weeks.  "Linux Cranks" eventually morphed into the "Kernel Panic Oggcast".  While Peter is on walkabout, the cast of KPO has resurrected "Tit Radio" on a temporary basis.  The listener is cautioned, while KPO is family friendly, "TiT Radio" makes no such commitment. Please join netminer, FiftyOneFifty, and pegwole as they drag you down the rabbit hole that has always been "TiT Radio".
