## hpr3509 :: Linux Inlaws S01E46: The Matrix Project (Without Neo)

 In this episode, the Inlaws are hosting Neil Johnson, VP of Engineering at Element. But this is
not just about this popular Matrix graphical user interface but rather about this federated communication
network dubbed as the next big thing after Mastodon and Discord, soon to take over the world (pretty
much like the Inlaws themselves - it's gonna get crowded... :-).
