## hpr2274 :: First Microsoft Surface Pro Ubuntu 16.04 Dual boot

 Hi. I purchased the first MS Pro on ebay after hearing of a like project on the Linux Action Show. I do a lot of traveling and I am always feeling bad about not having a something with open source on it.
So one of the best for travel is the MS surface pro.
In short it works great with Ubuntu.
