## hpr3820 :: Introduction to Gaming

 This starts out the series on Computer Strategy Games, and we begin
with the game that got me hooked, the first Civilization game created by
Sid Meier and published by Microprose. Though it is pretty old now, it
is still fond in my heart, and in the hearts of so many other gamers. If
this comes across as a love letter, so be it. We will also in this
series look at where you can obtain old games, and where you can find
more information about the games I cover.
