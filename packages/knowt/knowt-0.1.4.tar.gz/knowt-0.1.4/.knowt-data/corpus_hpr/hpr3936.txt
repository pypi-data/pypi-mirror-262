Site Migration

The process of moving the HPR site to its new location and
implementing all of the features has been going on during August:

Working on updating links on documentation pages
Moving RSS feeds from the dynamic part of the site to the static
side
Making the comment forms work the same as before
Making tags clickable
Fixing Unicode problems
Fixing various small bugs like the calculation of when to show the
"Call for shows" message""

There are a number of problems yet to be tackled:

Making links to pictures and other supplementary files work
Making links in comments clickable

We have had a number of very helpful problem reports, mainly
through the #HPR channel on Matrix.
It's also possible to raise issues on the Gitea site at https://repo.anhonesthost.net/rho_n/hpr_generator/issues,
though it's necessary to have a username on the site before this can be
done.
