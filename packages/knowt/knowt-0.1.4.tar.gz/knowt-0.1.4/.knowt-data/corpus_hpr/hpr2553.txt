## hpr2553 :: Get ahead with git HEAD

 This episode is light on actual commands, and mostly a narrative analysis of what git HEAD is and why it matters to you.
Some commands you can try:
$ cat ~/path/to/git/repo/.git/HEAD
and
$ ls ~/path/to/git/repo/.git/refs
$ cat ~/path/to/git/repo/.git/refs/master
