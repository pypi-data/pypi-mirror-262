## hpr1362 :: Fixing a bad RSS feed

 
There have been problems with the podcast feed for "mintCast",
apparently as a result of a bug in Wordpress. The feed contains
multiple "enclosure" tags containing the same audio over and over
again. While the mintCast hosts are looking for a fix I would like to
find a local work-around.


I have also encountered a problem with the "Pod Delusion Extra" feed
which contains multiple enclosures in some episodes. Unlike the
"mintCast" example I don't want to lose these enclosures but want to
find a way of repackaging them into individual episodes.


These problems affect some podcatchers, the modified Bashpodder I use
being amongst them. To counteract this problem I have written two
short Perl scripts to copy and clean each feed before submitting it to
my podcatcher.
