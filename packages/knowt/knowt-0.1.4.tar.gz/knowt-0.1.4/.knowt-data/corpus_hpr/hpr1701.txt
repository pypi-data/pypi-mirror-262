Website: https://github.com/DIYBookScanner/spreads


spreads is a software suite for the digitization of printed material. Its main focus is to integrate existing solutions for individual parts of the scanning workflow into a cohesive package that is intuitive to use and easy to extend. At its core, it handles the communication with the imaging devices, the post-processing of the captured material and its assembly into output formats like PDF or ePub. On top of this base layer, we have built a variety of interfaces that should fit into most use cases: A full-fledged and mobile-friendly web interface that can be served from even the most low-powered devices (like a Raspberry Pi), a graphical wizard for classical desktop users and a bare-bones command-line interface for purists.
