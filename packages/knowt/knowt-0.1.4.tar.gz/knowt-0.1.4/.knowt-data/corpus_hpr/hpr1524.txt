## hpr1524 :: WASHLUG 20150515 GPG and E-mail

 
This is a recording of a talk I gave at my local Linux Users Group, the Washtenaw Linux Users Group, or LUGWASH. In this talk I cover some of the theory of encryption, how to generate keys, and using this with Thunderbird, with Gmail, and on an Android phone.
