## hpr2629 :: Thoughts on language learning part 3 - game/story mode.

 This is the last of 3 parts on my thoughts on language learning. This one introduces my thoughts on how games might be used in language learning. More or less the same concepts from the first two episodes only applied to game/story design.
NOTE: Iâ€™m not a game designer.
On the off chance this sounds interesting to you, hpr2620 and hpr2625 are the other two.
