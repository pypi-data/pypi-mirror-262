## hpr2129 :: Gnu Awk - Part 2

 Gnu Awk - Part 2
This is the second episode in a series where b-yeezi and I will be looking at the AWK language (more particularly its GNU variant gawk). It is a comprehensive interpreted scripting language designed to be used for manipulating text.
I have written out a moderately long set of notes for this episode and these are available here https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr2129/full_shownotes.html.
