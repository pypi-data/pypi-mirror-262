android has newpipes for downloading youtube
windows youtube-DL script:
https://github.com/freeload101/SCRIPTS/blob/master/Windows_Batch/Youtube-dl-ffmpeg-aria2c-updater-downloader.bat

ffmpeg notes:

I started out by wanting to download facebook live streams and ended up missing it all together
Reference (no longer live by the time I got online... ): https://www.facebook.com/FormulaDRIFT/videos/452016008942956/
live video looks like something about mpd files with facebook also looks like you need ffmpeg complied with --enable-libxml2
this is where I found a WONDERFUL script https://github.com/jb-alvarado/media-autobuild_suite
also located other untested projects (pre compiled binaries ;/ ) https://www.videohelp.com/software/Hybrid
windows binary of youtube-dl for facebook/twitch.tv and youtube etc ..
https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html
oneliner to download/run media-autobuild_suite to "%userprofile%media-autobuild_suite-masterbuildffmpeg-gitbuild-static-64bit"

powershell   -Exec Bypass "IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://github.com/jb-alvarado/media-autobuild_suite/archive/master.zip',"%userprofile%desktopmaster.zip");   Expand-Archive -LiteralPath  "%userprofile%desktopmaster.zip"  -DestinationPath  "%userprofile%desktop"     ;Start-Process "%userprofile%desktopmedia-autobuild_suite-mastermedia-autobuild_suite.bat" "

this took over 8hrs to compile on a i7 I disabled items that had warnings and comments about issues and useless of codes that have issues etc
missing libopenh264.dll when I launched ffmpeg_g.exe
the dll was not built but I'm not sure it's something I messed up I'm sure
only post I saw online about it was that it's useless and -full should never be used flaming etc
start media-autobuild_suite-mastermsys64mingw64.exe and run the following
Reference : https://bluexmas.tistory.com/category/OS not sure what the flags were for but copied the DLL into the folder and it appears to run

git clone https://github.com/cisco/openh264.git
cd openh264
export "CFLAGS=-fno-stack-protector"
export "LDFLAGS=-lssp"
make

also had to apply this fix for AR etc in platform-mingw_nt.mk folder

find / -iname "platform-mingw_nt.mk" -exec sed 's/x86_64-w64-mingw32-//g' -i.bak '{}' ;
youtube-dl -f bestvideo+bestaudio "link to youtube video"
If that gives you an error, try the following instead:
youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/bestvideo+bestaudio' --merge-output-format mp4 "link to youtube video"
Here you download the best video and audio separately and then merge into a, in this case mp4 file. You can change the output format on the merged video as well.
