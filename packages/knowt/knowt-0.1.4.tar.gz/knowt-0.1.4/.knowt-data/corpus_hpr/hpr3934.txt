 Crusader Kings II
Crusader Kings II is a dynasty simulator, where your goal is to guide
your dynasty through the middle ages. It's very large game and this
episode can only scratch the surface.
You're a ruler of some kind, like count, duchess, king or empress to
name a few. You need to manage vassals in your realm and keep your
neighbours at bay. When you're not busy with that, you can relax and go
hunting, build an observatory or join a secret society (to name just a
few).
Couple first games will be overwhelming, but it'll get easier when
you start realizing how things affect to each other and what kinds of
things you can do.
