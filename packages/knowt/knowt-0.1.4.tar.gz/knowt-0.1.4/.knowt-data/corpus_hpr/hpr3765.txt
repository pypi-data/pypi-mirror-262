## hpr3765 :: Fixing clock events in GBA pokemon cartridges

 Pokemon games for the GBA (Game Boy Advance) have an internal RTC
chip with a coin battery to keep track of the time when the console is
powered off.
What happens when the internal battery runs dry? How to fix it?
Is this enough to completely restore calendar-based events?
