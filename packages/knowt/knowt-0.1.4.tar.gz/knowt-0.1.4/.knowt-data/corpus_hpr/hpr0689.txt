The Eurotrash Security Podcast

Most podcasts in the Information Security realm are US-focused. While we love and continue to listen to these, we thought something was missing: a EU-focused Information Security Podcast. And this is our attempt to provide you with one. Easy? Not at all. Podcasting is hard, no doubt about that, and we will probably suck for some dozen episodes to come. But we believe that we will get there, just bear with us ...

Episode 19: Haroon Meer is one kick-ass dude from South Africa and found some spare time to talk to us on infosec, his new venture Thinkst, Zacon and other stuff! And Wicked Clown is back!
