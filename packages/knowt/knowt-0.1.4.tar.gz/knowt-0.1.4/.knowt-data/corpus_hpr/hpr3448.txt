## hpr3448 :: Installing GuixSD

 Synopsis
In this episode Rho`n records his adventure in installing GuixSD on an external USB drive which will be run on a Mac Mini computer. After overcoming the initial difficulty of finding a keyboard that would connect wirelessly to the Mac Mini while using the Guix installer and some network difficulties, he describes the installation steps.
Guix has a graphical text based installer. It is reminiscent of the mid to late 90s Debian installers. Even with its old school feel, the installer is very nice. It is well laid out, has good onscreen description for each step of the installation process, and provides ample configuration selections from language, to to key board layout, to desktop and software selection.
