## hpr1608 :: Interviews at Lincoln LUG

 In today's show, Philip Newborough interviews fellow members of Lincoln LUG. Each interviewee is asked 3 simple questions:

What was your first experience of Linux?
What distro and desktop environment/window manager are you currently using?
What tools/utilities/applications can you not live without?

The participating LUG members were not given the questions in advance and the resulting answers were quite varied. Hopefully, this collection of interviews will provide you, the listener, with a good understanding of the broad mix of Linux users who attend Lincoln LUG.The members who were interviewed, in order, were:

Dave Armour
Myles Thaiss
Phil Gobbett
Jo Minchin
Graham Markall
Sarah Markall
Becky Newborough
Darren Scott
Adrian Farrow
Emma Martin

Note: Lincoln LUG meets on the 3rd Wednesday of each month at the Lincoln Bowl. The interviews were conducted outside the bowl and some background noise can be heard, we hope this does not affect your enjoyment of this episode.
