## hpr3539 :: Linux Inlaws S01E50: The OpenSUSE Project

 In this episode of the Inlaws our two ageing heroes host Doug DeMaio and Axel Braun, both intimately
associated with and actively supporting the OpenSUSE project, the foundation of one of the popular Linux distros
apart from RedHat and Debian for companies of all sizes (yes, and Ubuntu before I get any hate mails
from Mark Shuttleworth or Cannonical in general :-). Apologies for not mentioning Alma, CentOS or
Rocky Linux. Topics of discussion include the advantages of hipster concepts like rolling releases,
the year of the Linux desktop, other people's computers (aka Clouds) and philosophical things like
IT security, all things cloud-native (well, almost) and Apple laptop users drinking fancy coffee
derivatives. Never mind containers, edge-computing operating systems and live kernel patching.
