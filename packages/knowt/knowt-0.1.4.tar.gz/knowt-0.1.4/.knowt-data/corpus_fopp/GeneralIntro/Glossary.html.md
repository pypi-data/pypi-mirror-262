#### Before you keep reading\...

Runestone Academy can only continue if we get support from individuals
like you. As a student you are well aware of the high cost of textbooks.
Our mission is to provide great books to you for free, but we ask that
you consider a \$10 donation, more if you can or less if \$10 is a
burden.

#### Before you keep reading\...

Making great stuff takes time and \$\$. If you appreciate the book you
are reading now and want to keep quality materials free for other
students please consider a donation to Runestone Academy. We ask that
you consider a \$10 donation, but if you can give more thats great, if
\$10 is too much for your budget we would be happy with whatever you can
afford as a show of support.

========================================================================================

activecode[¶](#term-activecode "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A unique interpreter environment that allows Python to be executed
    from within a web browser.

algorithm[¶](#term-algorithm "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will
    solve the problem under consideration.

bug[¶](#term-bug "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   An error in a program.

byte code[¶](#term-byte-code "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   An intermediate language between source code and object code. Many
    modern languages first compile source code into byte code and then
    interpret the byte code with a program called a *virtual machine*.

codelens[¶](#term-codelens "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   An interactive environment that allows the user to control the step
    by step execution of a Python program

comment[¶](#term-comment "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or
    anyone reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution
    of the program.

compile[¶](#term-compile "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   To translate a program written in a high-level language into a
    low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.

debugging[¶](#term-debugging "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of
    programming errors: **\*syntax error\***, **\*semantic error\***,
    and **\*runtime error\***.

exception[¶](#term-exception "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   Another name for a runtime error.

executable[¶](#term-executable "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.

formal language[¶](#term-formal-language "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific
    purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer
    programs; all programming languages are formal languages.

high-level language[¶](#term-high-level-language "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for
    humans to read and write.

interpret[¶](#term-interpret "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one
    line at a time.

low-level language[¶](#term-low-level-language "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to
    execute; also called machine language or assembly language.

natural language[¶](#term-natural-language "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.

object code[¶](#term-object-code "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   The output of the compiler after it translates the program.

parse[¶](#term-parse "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

portability[¶](#term-portability "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of
    computer.

print function[¶](#term-print-function "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A function used in a program or script that causes the Python
    interpreter to display a value on its output device.

problem solving[¶](#term-problem-solving "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and
    expressing the solution.

program[¶](#term-program "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and
    computations to be performed.

programming language[¶](#term-programming-language "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer
    or computing device to perform specific tasks.

Python shell[¶](#term-Python-shell "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter, and the
    user of a Python shell types commands at the prompt (\>\>\>), and
    presses the return key to send these commands immediately to the
    interpreter for processing. To initiate the Python Shell, the user
    should open theterminal and type "python". Once the user presses
    enter, the Python Shell appears and the user can interact with it.

runtime error[¶](#term-runtime-error "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   An error that does not occur until the program has started to
    execute but that prevents the program from continuing.

semantic error[¶](#term-semantic-error "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the
    programmer intended.

semantics[¶](#term-semantics "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   The meaning of a program.

shell mode[¶](#term-shell-mode "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   A mode of using Python where expressions can be typed and executed
    in the command prompt, and the results are shown immediately in the
    command terminal window. Shell mode is initiated by opening the
    terminal of your operating system and typing "python". Press enter
    and the Python Shell will appear. This is in contrast to **source
    code**. Also see the entry under **Python shell**.

source code[¶](#term-source-code "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   The instructions in a program, stored in a file, in a high-level
    language before being compiled or interpreted.

syntax[¶](#term-syntax "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   The structure of a program.

syntax error[¶](#term-syntax-error "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse --- and
    therefore impossible to interpret.

token[¶](#term-token "Permalink to this term"){.headerlink}

:   One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program,
    analogous to a word in a natural language.
