Runestone Academy can only continue if we get support from individuals
like you. As a student you are well aware of the high cost of textbooks.
Our mission is to provide great books to you for free, but we ask that
you consider a \$10 donation, more if you can or less if \$10 is a
burden.

Making great stuff takes time and \$\$. If you appreciate the book you
are reading now and want to keep quality materials free for other
students please consider a donation to Runestone Academy. We ask that
you consider a \$10 donation, but if you can give more thats great, if
\$10 is too much for your budget we would be happy with whatever you can
afford as a show of support.

======================================================================================================================

Earlier when we discussed cloning and aliasing lists we had mentioned
that simply cloning a list using \[:\] would take care of any issues
with having two lists unintentionally connected to each other. That was
definitely true for making shallow copies (copying a list at the highest
level), but as we get into nested data, and nested lists in particular,
the rules become a bit more complicated. We can have second-level
aliasing in these cases, which means we need to make deep copies.

When you copy a nested list, you do not also get copies of the internal
lists. This means that if you perform a mutation operation on one of the
original sublists, the copied version will also change. We can see this
happen in the following nested list, which only has two levels.

::: {.runestone .explainer .ac_section}
::: {#ac17_100_1 component="activecode" question_label="17.6.1"}
::: {#ac17_100_1_question .ac_question}
:::
:::
:::

Assuming that you don't want to have aliased lists inside of your nested
list, then you'll need to perform nested iteration.

::: {.runestone .explainer .ac_section}
::: {#ac17_100_2 component="activecode" question_label="17.6.2"}
::: {#ac17_100_2_question .ac_question}
:::
:::
:::

Or, equivalently, you could take advantage of the slice operator to do
the copying of the inner list.

::: {.runestone .explainer .ac_section}
::: {#ac17_100_2a component="activecode" question_label="17.6.3"}
::: {#ac17_100_2a_question .ac_question}
:::
:::
:::

This process above works fine when there are only two layers or levels
in a nested list. However, if we want to make a copy of a nested list
that has *more* than two levels, then we recommend using the
`copy`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} module. In the `copy`{.docutils
.literal .notranslate} module there is a method called
`deepcopy`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} that will take care of the
operation for you.
