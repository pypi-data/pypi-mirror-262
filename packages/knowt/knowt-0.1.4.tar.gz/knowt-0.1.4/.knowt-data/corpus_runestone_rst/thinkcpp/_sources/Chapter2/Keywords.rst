Keywords
--------

.. index::
   single: keyword

A few sections ago, I said that you can make up any name you want for
your variables, but thatâ€™s not quite true. There are certain words that
are reserved in C++ because they are used by the compiler to parse the
structure of your program, and if you use them as variable names, it
will get confused. These words, called **keywords**, include ``int``, ``char``,
``void``, ``endl`` and many more.

A list of C++ keywords is availiable publically on ``cppreference``.  You can
take a look for yourself by pasting the following link into your browser.

Rather than memorize the list, I would suggest that you take advantage
of a feature provided in many development environments: code
highlighting. As you type, different parts of your program should appear
in different colors. For example, keywords might be blue, strings red,
and other code black. 

.. Warning::
   If you type a variable name and it turns blue, watch out! You might get 
   some strange behavior from the compiler.

.. note::
   Case matters!  You can name a ``string`` variable ``String`` without an issue
   because C++ does not consider ``String`` to be the same as keyword ``string``.
   Also, a anything written in quotes, for example ``"string"`` is not considered
   a keyword in C++, even if it is spelt the same.

   Words that are reserved in C++ because they are used by the compiler to parse the structure of your program are called |blank|.

   :answer_a: integer
   :answer_b: cout
   :answer_c: variable
   :answer_d: string
   :answer_e: char
   :correct: b,d,e
   :feedback_a: integer is not a keyword, but int is.
   :feedback_b: cout cannot be used as a variable name!
   :feedback_c: variable is fair game to use to name a variable.
   :feedback_d: string cannot be used as a variable name.
   :feedback_e: char is a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name.

   Multiple Response: Which of the following are keywords or will otherwise generate some error from the compiler if used as a variable name?

   Fix the code below so that it runs without errors.  Hint: you might need to change the names of some variables.
   ~~~~
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   
   int main () {
       int friend = 4;
       int enemy = friend * (-1);
       cout << "enemy = " << enemy << endl;

       // Do not modify anything below.
       return 0;
   }
