Stack Diagrams for Recursive Functions

   single: stack diagram

In the previous chapter we used a **stack diagram** to represent the state
of a program during a function call. The same kind of diagram can make
it easier to interpret a recursive function.

Remember that every time a function gets called it creates a new
instance that contains the functionâ€™s local variables and parameters.

This figure shows a stack diagram for ``countdown``, called with ``n = 3``:

.. figure:: Images/4.9stackdiagram.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center
   :alt: image

There is one instance of ``main`` and **four** instances of ``countdown``, each with
a different value for the parameter ``n``. The bottom of the stack,
``countdown`` with ``n = 0`` is the base case. It does not make a recursive call,
so there are no more instances of ``countdown``.

The instance of ``main`` is empty because main does not have any parameters
or local variables. As an exercise, draw a stack diagram for ``nLines``,
invoked with the parameter n = 4.

.. mchoice:: stack_1
   :answer_a: 3
   :answer_b: 4
   :answer_c: 5
   :answer_d: infinite
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: If nLines could reach its base case, it cannot be done in 3 function calls.
   :feedback_b: If nLines could reach its base case, it cannot be done in 4 function calls.
   :feedback_c: If nLines could reach its base case, it could be done in 5 function calls, but does it ever reach the base case?
   :feedback_d: The nLines function never reaches its base case, so the stack diagram would be infinitely long.

   Refer to the ``nLines`` function below.  It is the same as the ``nLines``
   function defined on the previous page.  How many instances of ``nLines``
   would there be in the stack diagram if we begin with n = 4?

   ::
     
       void nLines(int n) {
         if (n > 0) {
           cout << endl;
           nLines(n + 1);
         }
       }
