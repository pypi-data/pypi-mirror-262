Add your own Question
=====================

In the final exercise for the night, add your own question to the exercise bank using the web interface.

You can make it any kind of question you would like, but it would be great if it was a real exercise that you like to use in one of your own courses.

To keep the build system from bogging down, you can let me know once you have saved an exercise and I'll pull it into the sigcse2019 book and build it for you. 

.. warning::

    Make sure you assign at least 0 points to your question before you press done.  If everything works, you will get a popup telling you that the question has been added successfully.
