    sort
        A method that sorts a list in place, changing the contents of the list. It
        return None, not a new list.
        
    sorted
        A function that returns a sorted list, without changing the original.
        
    reverse parameter
        If True, the sorting is done in reverse order.
        
    key parameter
        If a value is specified, it must be a function object that takes one parameter.
        The function will be called once for each item in the list that's getting
        sorted. The return value will be used to decorate the item with a post-it
        note. Values on the post-it notes are used to determine the sort order of
        the items.
