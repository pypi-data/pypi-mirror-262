<h2>Chapter 1</h2>



<h1>The way of the program</h1>
<p>
The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a
computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features
of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.  Like mathematicians,
computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically
computations).  Like engineers, they design things, assembling components
into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives.  Like scientists,
they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test
predictions.
<p>
The single most important skill for a computer scientist is <b>problem solving</b>.  Problem solving means the ability to formulate
problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly
and accurately.  As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills.  That's why
this chapter is called, "The way of the program."
<p>
On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful
skill by itself.  On another level, you will use programming as a means to
an end.  As we go along, that end will become clearer.

<a name=1></a>
<h3>1.1 The Python programming language</h3>
<p>
The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is
an example of a <b>high-level language</b>; other high-level languages
you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java.
<p>
As you might infer from the name "high-level language," there are
also <b>low-level languages</b>, sometimes referred to as "machine
languages" or "assembly languages."  Loosely speaking, computers
can only execute programs written in low-level languages.  Thus,
programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before
they can run.  This extra processing takes some time, which is a small
disadvantage of high-level languages.
<p>
But the advantages are enormous.  First, it is much easier to program
in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language
take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they
are more likely to be correct.  Second, high-level languages are <b>portable</b>, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers
with few or no modifications.  Low-level programs can run on only one
kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.
<p>
Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level
languages.  Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized
applications.
<p>
Two kinds of programs process high-level languages
into low-level languages: <b>interpreters</b> and <b>compilers</b>.
An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it
does what the program says.  It processes the program a little at a time,
alternately reading lines and performing computations.

<p align="center"><img src="illustrations/interpret.png"></p>
<p>
A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the
program starts running.  In this case, the high-level program is
called the <b>source code</b>, and the translated program is called the
<b>object code</b> or the <b>executable</b>.  Once a program is
compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.

<p align="center"><img src="illustrations/compile.png"></p>
<p>
Python is considered an interpreted language because Python
programs are executed by an interpreter.  There are two ways to
use the interpreter: command-line mode and script mode. In
command-line mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter
prints the result:

<p><tt><font size=-1>$ python
<br>Python 2.4.1 (<font color=#009000>#1, Apr 29 2005, 00:28:56)
</font><br>Type <font color=red>"help"</font>, <font color=red>"copyright"</font>, <font color=red>"credits"</font> <font color=black>or</font> <font color=red>"license"</font> <font color=black>for</font> more information.
<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <font color=black>print</font> 1 + 1
<br>2
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
The first line of this example is the command that starts the
Python interpreter.  The next two lines are messages from the
interpreter.  The third line starts with <tt><font size=-1>&gt;&gt;&gt;</font></tt>, which is the
prompt the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready.  We typed
<tt><font size=-1><font color=black>print</font> 1 + 1</font></tt>, and the interpreter replied <tt><font size=-1>2</font></tt>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can write a program in a file and use the
interpreter to execute the contents of the file.  Such a file is
called a <b>script</b>.  For example, we used a text editor to
create a file named <tt><font size=-1>latoya.py</font></tt> with the following contents:

<p><tt><font size=-1><font color=black>print</font> 1 + 1
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
By convention, files that contain Python programs have names that
end with <tt><font size=-1>.py</font></tt>.
<p>
To execute the program, we have to tell the interpreter the name of
the script:

<p><tt><font size=-1>$ python latoya.py
<br>2
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
In other development environments, the details of executing programs
may differ.  Also, most programs are more interesting than this one.
<p>
Most of the examples in this book are executed on the command line.
Working on the command line is convenient for program development and
testing, because you can type programs and execute them
immediately.  Once you have a working program, you should store
it in a script so you can execute or modify it in the future.

<h3>1.2 What is a program?</h3>
<p>
A <b>program</b> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to
perform a computation.  The computation might be something
mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the
roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such
as searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough)
compiling a program.
<p>
The details look different in
different languages, but a few basic instructions
appear in just about every language:

<dl>
<dt>input</dt>
<dd>Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some
other device.</dd>
<dt>output</dt>
<dd>Display data on the screen or send data to a
file or other device.</dd>
<dt>math</dt>
<dd>Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
multiplication.</dd>
<dt>conditional execution</dt>
<dd>Check for certain conditions and
execute the appropriate sequence of statements.</dd>
<dt>repetition</dt>
<dd>Perform some action repeatedly, usually with
some variation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it.  Every
program you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of
instructions that look more or less like these.  Thus, we can
describe programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task
into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are
simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions.
<p>
That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic later
when we talk about <b>algorithms</b>.

<h3>1.3 What is debugging?</h3>
<p>
Programming is a complex process, and because it is done by human beings,
it often leads to errors.  For whimsical reasons, programming errors are
called <b>bugs</b> and the process of tracking them down and correcting them
is called <b>debugging</b>.
<p>
Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime 
errors, and semantic errors. It is useful
to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.

<h4>Syntax errors</h4>
<p>
Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically
correct; otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message.
<b>Syntax</b> refers to the structure of a program and the rules about
that structure.  For example, in English, a sentence must
begin with a capital letter and end with a period.  this sentence contains
a <b>syntax error</b>.  So does this one
<p>
For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem,
which is why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without spewing error
messages.  Python is not so forgiving.  If there is a single syntax error
anywhere in your program, Python will print an error message and quit,
and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few weeks
of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking
down syntax errors.  As you gain experience, though, you will make fewer
errors and find them faster.

<h4>Runtime errors</h4>
<p>
The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the
error does not appear until you run the program.  These errors are also
called <b>exceptions</b> because they usually indicate that something
exceptional (and bad) has happened.
<p>
Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the
first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.

<h4>Semantic errors</h4>
<p>
The third type of error is the <b>semantic error</b>.  If there is a
semantic error in your program, it will run successfully, in the sense
that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will
not do the right thing.  It will do something else.  Specifically, it
will do what you told it to do.
<p>
The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you
wanted to write.  The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong.
Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work
backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure
out what it is doing.

<h4>Experimental debugging</h4>
<p>
One of the most important skills you will acquire is
debugging.  Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the
most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming.
<p>
In some ways, debugging is like detective work.  You are confronted
with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led
to the results you see.
<p>
Debugging is also like an experimental science.  Once you have an idea
what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again.  If your
hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the
modification, and you take a step closer to a working program.  If
your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one.  As
Sherlock Holmes pointed out, "When you have eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
(A. Conan Doyle, <i>The Sign of Four</i>)
<p>
For some people, programming and debugging are the
same thing.  That is, programming is the process of gradually
debugging a program until it does what you want.  The idea
is that you should start with a program that
does <i>something</i> and make small modifications, debugging
them as you go, so that you always have a working program.
<p>
For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of
lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds
used to explore the Intel 80386 chip.  According to Larry Greenfield,
"One of Linus's earlier projects was a program that would switch
between printing AAAA and BBBB.  This later evolved to Linux."
(<i>The Linux Users' Guide</i> Beta Version 1)
<p>
Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other
programming practices.

<h3>1.4 Formal and natural languages</h3>
<p>
<b>Natural languages</b> are the languages that people speak,
such as English, Spanish, and French.  They were not designed
by people (although people try to impose some order on them);
they evolved naturally.
<p>
<b>Formal languages</b> are languages that are designed by people for
specific applications.  For example, the notation that mathematicians
use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting
relationships among numbers and symbols.  Chemists use a formal
language to represent the chemical structure of molecules.  And
most importantly:

<blockquote><b>Programming languages are formal languages that have been
designed to express computations.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax.  For example,
<tt>3+3=6</tt> is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but
<tt><font size=-1>3=+6$</font></tt> is not.  <tt>H<sub>2</sub>O</tt> is a syntactically correct chemical name,
but <tt><sub>2</sub>Zz</tt> is not.
<p>
Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to <b>tokens</b> and structure.
Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers,
and chemical elements.  One of the problems with <tt><font size=-1>3=+6$</font></tt> is that
<tt><font size=-1>$</font></tt> is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as we
know).  Similarly, <tt><sub>2</sub>Zz</tt> is not legal because there is no element with
the abbreviation <tt>Zz</tt>.
<p>
The second type of syntax error pertains to the structure of a
statement <s>&nbsp; &nbsp;</s> that is, the way the tokens are arranged.  The statement
<tt><font size=-1>3=+6$</font></tt> is structurally illegal because you can't place a plus
sign immediately after an equal sign.  Similarly, molecular formulas
have to have subscripts after the element name, not before.

<blockquote><i>As an exercise, create what appears to be a well-structured English
sentence with unrecognizable tokens in it.  Then write another sentence
with all valid tokens but with invalid structure.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal
language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is
(although in a natural language you do this subconsciously).  This
process is called <b>parsing</b>.
<p>
For example, when you hear the sentence, "The other shoe fell," you
understand that "the other shoe" is the subject and "fell" is the
predicate.  Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it
means, or the semantics of the sentence.  Assuming that you know
what a shoe is and what it means to fall, you will understand the
general implication of this sentence.
<p>
Although formal and natural languages have many features in
common <s>&nbsp; &nbsp;</s> tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics <s>&nbsp; &nbsp;</s> there are many
differences:

<dl>
<dt>ambiguity</dt>
<dd>Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which
people deal with by using contextual clues and other information.
Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous,
which means that any statement has exactly one meaning,
regardless of context.</dd>
<dt>redundancy</dt>
<dd>In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce
misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of
redundancy.  As a result, they are often verbose.  Formal languages
are less redundant and more concise.</dd>
<dt>literalness</dt>
<dd>Natural languages are full of idiom and
metaphor.  If I say, "The other shoe fell," there is probably
no shoe and nothing falling.  Formal languages mean
exactly what they say.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
People who grow up speaking a natural language <s>&nbsp; &nbsp;</s> everyone <s>&nbsp; &nbsp;</s> often have a
hard time adjusting to formal languages.  In some ways, the difference
between formal and natural language is like the difference between
poetry and prose, but more so:

<dl>
<dt>Poetry</dt>
<dd>Words are used for their sounds as well as for
their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or
emotional response.  Ambiguity is not only common but often
deliberate.</dd>
<dt>Prose</dt>
<dd>The literal meaning of words is more important,
and the structure contributes more meaning.  Prose is more amenable to
analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.</dd>
<dt>Programs</dt>
<dd>The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous
and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the
tokens and structure.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal
languages).  First, remember that formal languages are much more dense
than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them.  Also, the
structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read
from top to bottom, left to right.  Instead, learn to parse the
program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the
structure.  Finally, the details matter.  Little things
like spelling errors and bad punctuation, which you can get away
with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal
language.

<h3>1.5 The first program</h3>
<p>
Traditionally, the first program written in a new language
is called "Hello, World!" because all it does is display the
words, "Hello, World!"  In Python, it looks like this:

<p><tt><font size=-1><font color=black>print</font> <font color=red>"Hello, World!"</font>
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
This is an example of a <b>print statement</b>, which doesn't
actually print anything on paper.  It displays a value on the
screen.  In this case, the result is the words

<p><tt><font size=-1>Hello, World!
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end
of the value; they don't appear in the result.
<p>
Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the
simplicity of the "Hello, World!" program.  By this standard, Python
does about as well as possible.
