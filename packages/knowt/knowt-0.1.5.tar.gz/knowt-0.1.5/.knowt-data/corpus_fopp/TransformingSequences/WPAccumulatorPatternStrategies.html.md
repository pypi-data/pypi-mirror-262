------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When children first encounter word problems in their math classes, they
find it difficult to translate those words into arithmetic expressions
involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Teachers
offer heuristics. If the problem says "how many...altogether", that's an
addition problem. If it says "how many are left", that's going to be a
subtraction problem.

Learning to use the accumulator pattern can be similarly confusing. The
first step is to recognizing something in the problem statement that
suggests an accumulation pattern. Here are a few. You might want to try
adding some more of your own.

Accumulation Pattern

how many

count accumulation

how frequently

total

sum accumulation

a list of

list accumulation

concatenate

string accumulation

join together

For example, if the problem is to compute the total distance traveled in
a series of small trips, you would want to accumulate a sum. If the
problem is to make a list of the cubes of all the numbers from 1-25, you
want a list accumulation, starting with an empty list and appending one
more cube each time. If the problem is to make a comma separated list of
all the people invited to a party, you should think of concatenating
them; you could start with an empty string and concatenate one more
person on each iteration through a list of name.

::: {#before-writing-it .section}
[9.14.2. ]{.section-number}Before Writing it[¬∂](#before-writing-it "Permalink to this heading"){.headerlink}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before writing any code, we recommend that you first answer the
following questions:

-   What sequence will you iterate through as you accumulate a result?
    It could be a range of numbers, the letters in a string, or some
    existing list that you have just as a list of names.

-   What type of value will you accumulate? If your final result will be
    a number, your accumulator will start out with a number and always
    have a number even as it is updated each time. Similarly, if your
    final result will be a list, start with a list. If your final result
    will be a string, you'll probably want to start with a string; one
    other option is to accumulate a list of strings and then use the
    .join() method at the end to concatenate them all together.

We recommend writing your answers to these questions in a comment. As
you encounter bugs and have to look things up, it will help remind you
of what you were trying to implement. Sometimes, just writing the
comment can help you to realize a potential problem and avoid it before
you ever write any code.

[9.14.3. ]{.section-number}Choosing Good Accumulator and Iterator Variable Names[¬∂](#choosing-good-accumulator-and-iterator-variable-names "Permalink to this heading"){.headerlink}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final piece of advice regarding accumulation strategies is to be
intentional when choosing variable names for the accumulator and
iterator variables. A good name can help remind you of what the value is
assigned to the variable as well as what you should have by the end of
your code. While it might be tempting at first to use a short variable
name, such as `a`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} or `x`{.docutils
.literal .notranslate}, if you run into any bugs or look at your code
later, you may have trouble understanding what you intended to do and
what your code is actually doing.

For the accumulator variable, one thing that can help is to make the
variable name end with "so\_far". The prefix can be something that helps
remind you of what you're supposed to end up with. For example:
count\_so\_far, total\_so\_far, or cubes\_so\_far.

As mentioned previously in a previous Way of the Programmer segment,
[[üë©‚Äçüíª Naming Variables in For Loops]{.std
.std-ref}](../Iteration/WPNamingVariablesinForLoops.html#naming-variables-in-for-loops){.reference
.internal}, the iterator variable should be a singular noun. It should
describe what one item in the original sequence, not what one item in
the final result will be. For example, when accumulating the cubes of
the numbers from 1-25, don't write for cube in range(25):. Instead,
write for num in range(25):. If you name the iterator variable cube you
run the risk of getting confused that it has already been cubed, when
that's an operation that you still have to write in your code.
