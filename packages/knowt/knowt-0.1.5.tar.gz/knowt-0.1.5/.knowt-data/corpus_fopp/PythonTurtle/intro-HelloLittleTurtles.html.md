Runestone Academy can only continue if we get support from individuals
like you. As a student you are well aware of the high cost of textbooks.
Our mission is to provide great books to you for free, but we ask that
you consider a \$10 donation, more if you can or less if \$10 is a
burden.

Making great stuff takes time and \$\$. If you appreciate the book you
are reading now and want to keep quality materials free for other
students please consider a donation to Runestone Academy. We ask that
you consider a \$10 donation, but if you can give more thats great, if
\$10 is too much for your budget we would be happy with whatever you can
afford as a show of support.

There are many *modules* in Python that provide very powerful features
that we can use in our own programs. Some of these can send email or
fetch web pages. Others allow us to perform complex mathematical
calculations. In this chapter we will introduce a module that allows us
to create a data object called a **turtle** that can be used to draw
pictures.

Turtle graphics, as it is known, is based on a very simple metaphor.
Imagine that you have a turtle that understands English. You can tell
your turtle to do simple commands such as go forward and turn right. As
the turtle moves around, if its tail is down touching the ground, it
will draw a line (leave a trail behind) as it moves. If you tell your
turtle to lift up its tail it can still move around but will not leave a
trail. As you will see, you can make some pretty amazing drawings with
this simple capability.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

The turtles are fun because they allow us to visualize what our code is
doing, but the real purpose of the chapter is to teach ourselves a
little more Python and to develop our theme of computational thinking.
You'll first draw simple geometric shapes with the turtles, and then
we'll summarize the concepts and syntax you've learned, in particular,
classes, instances, and method invocations. These concepts are the
building blocks of object-oriented programming, a paradigm for
structuring a program that is widespread in every modern programming
language.
