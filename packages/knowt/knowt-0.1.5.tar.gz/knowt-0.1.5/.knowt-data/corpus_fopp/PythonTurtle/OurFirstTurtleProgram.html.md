[5.2. ]{.section-number}Our First Turtle Program[¬∂](#our-first-turtle-program "Permalink to this heading"){.headerlink}
=======================================================================================================================

Let's try a couple of lines of Python code to create a new turtle and
start drawing a simple figure like a rectangle. We will refer to our
first turtle using the variable name alex, but remember that you can
choose any name you wish as long as you follow the naming rules from the
previous chapter.

The program as shown will only draw the first two sides of the
rectangle. After line 4 you will have a straight line going from the
center of the drawing canvas towards the right. After line 6, you will
have a canvas with a turtle and a half drawn rectangle. Press the run
button to try it and see.

Here are a couple of things you'll need to understand about this
program.

The first line tells Python to load a **module** named
`turtle`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}. That module brings us two new
types that we can use: the `Turtle`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}
type, and the `Screen`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} type. The dot
notation `turtle.Turtle`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} means *"The
Turtle type that is defined within the turtle module"*. (Remember that
Python is case sensitive, so the module name, `turtle`{.docutils
.literal .notranslate}, with a lowercase `t`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate}, is different from the type `Turtle`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate} because of the uppercase `T`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate}.)

We then create and open what the turtle module calls a screen (we would
prefer to call it a window, or in the case of this web version of Python
simply a canvas), which we assign to variable `wn`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate}. Every window contains a **canvas**, which is the area
inside the window on which we can draw.

In line 3 we create a turtle. The variable `alex`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate} is made to refer to this turtle. These first three lines
set us up so that we are ready to do some drawing.

In lines 4-6, we instruct the **object** alex to move and to turn. We do
this by **invoking** or activating alex's **methods** --- these are the
instructions that all turtles know how to respond to.

::: {.admonition-complete-the-rectangle .admonition}
Complete the rectangle ...

Modify the program by adding the commands necessary to have *alex*
complete the rectangle.

**Mixed up programs**

::: {.parsons_question .parsons-text}
The following program uses a turtle to draw a capital L as shown in the
picture to the left of this text:

[![image of a navigational compass and a letter L which is drawn by
Turtle](../_images/TurtleL4.png){.align-left}](../_images/TurtleL4.png){.reference
.internal .image-reference}

But the lines are mixed up. The program should do all necessary set-up:
import the turtle module, get the window to draw on, and create the
turtle. Remember that the turtle starts off facing east when it is
created. The turtle should turn to face south and draw a line that is
150 pixels long and then turn to face east and draw a line that is 75
pixels long. We have added a compass to the picture to indicate the
directions north, south, west, and east.

An object can have various methods --- things it can do --- and it can
also have **attributes** --- (sometimes called *properties*). For
example, each turtle has a *color* attribute. The method invocation
`alex.color("red")`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} will make alex red
and the line that it draws will be red too.

The color of the turtle, the width of its pen(tail), the position of the
turtle within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part
of its current **state**. Similarly, the window object has a background
color which is part of its state.

Quite a number of methods exist that allow us to modify the turtle and
window objects. In the example below, we show just show a couple and
have only commented those lines that are different from the previous
example. Note also that we have decided to call our turtle object
*tess*.

The last line plays a very important role. The wn variable refers to the
window shown above. When we invoke its `exitonclick`{.docutils .literal
.notranslate} method, the program pauses execution and waits for the
user to click the mouse somewhere in the window. When this click event
occurs, the response is to close the turtle window and exit (stop
execution of) the Python program.

Each time we run this program, a new drawing window pops up, and will
remain on the screen until we click on it.

::: {.admonition-extend-this-program .admonition}
Extend this program ...

1.  Modify this program so that before it creates the window, it prompts
    the user to enter the desired background color.It should store the
    user's responses in a variable, and modify the color of the window
    according to the user's wishes. (Hint: you can find a list of
    permitted color names at
    <https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp>. It includes
    some quite unusual ones, like "PeachPuff" and "HotPink".)

2.  Do similar changes to allow the user, at runtime, to set tess'
    color.

3.  Do the same for the width of tess' pen. *Hint:* your dialog with the
    user will return a string, but tess' `pensize`{.docutils .literal
    .notranslate} method expects its argument to be an `int`{.docutils
    .literal .notranslate}. That means you need to convert the string to
    an int before you pass it to `pensize`{.docutils .literal
    .notranslate}.
