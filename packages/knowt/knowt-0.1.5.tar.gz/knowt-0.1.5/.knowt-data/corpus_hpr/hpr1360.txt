TGTM as a general newscast now over
Hey, Ken,

I just published TGTM news #103, which is my explanation of its
closure and next month's new format.  I now plan to do two audios a
month, one tech piece for HPR and one non-tech for my personal site.

Could you please announce this in the next HPR community news, as well
as putting this link in the show notes:
