## hpr3518 :: Linux Inlaws S01E47: BigBlueButton and NAT

 In this episode of your favourite FLOSS podcast our two OAPs discuss the challenges of running
conferencing systems like BigBlueButton behind a network address translation
(NAT) configuration, something that the Inlaws have been struggeling (?) with
for quite some time but now have arrived a solution which might just work :-).
If you face similar challenges or just want to refresh your knowledge about
intricate network architectures never mind their pitfalls, stay tuned.  All
will be revealed (hopefully :-). But beware: This show is highly technical and
geek-only.  Which may come in handy if you're not technical but suffer from
insomnia or similar sleep disorders - this is your show!
