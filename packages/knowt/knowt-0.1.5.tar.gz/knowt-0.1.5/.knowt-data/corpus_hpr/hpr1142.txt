## hpr1142 :: LiTS 020: pgrep and pkill

 
This episode the focus will be on two commands that go hand-in-hand: pgrep and pkill. Like the kill command, pkill is used to send a signal to a process usually with the intent to terminate or stop the process. Instead of passing the Process ID (PID) you can pass the process name:

pkill xterm
