## hpr2776 :: Sub-Plots In Storytelling

 What makes for strong subplots? Why can some subplots be chopped out of a tale without harming it? Why can some be chopped out, and it actually makes the tale stronger? Is this modular approach the best way to bring in subplots, or is there another method that might be better?
Story construction is a complicated topic; Lostnbronx tries (and largely fails) to make sense of this small part of it.
