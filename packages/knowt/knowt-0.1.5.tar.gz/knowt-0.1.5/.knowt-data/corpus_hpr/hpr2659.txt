## hpr2659 :: Further ancillary Bash tips - 11

 Further ancillary Bash tips - 11
This is the eleventh episode in the Bash Tips sub-series. It is the third of a group of shows about making decisions in Bash.
In the last two episodes we saw the types of test Bash provides, and we looked briefly at some of the commands that use these tests. Now we want to start examining the expressions that can be used in these tests, and how to combine them. We will also start looking at string comparisons in extended tests.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
