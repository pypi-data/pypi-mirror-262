## hpr0001 :: Introduction to HPR

 
In this first ever show on Hacker Public Radio, StankDawg and Enigma introduce HPR.


The story of Hacker Public Radio begins where Radio FreeK America leaves off. StankDawg was a busy with Binary Revolution Radio and so the idea lay dormant for some time. Then droops, another podcaster (Infonomicon) who was inspired by RFA got together with dosman to start TWaTech Today with a Techie, a pun on Twit. About a year in Enigma took over operations from portrello.


Continuing on from Today with a Techie, HPR will air anything that is Of interest to hackers. Think, hacking, phone preaking, politics, survival, caffeine, linux, movie reviews, game reviews, etc. There is no restriction on the length but the shows will have the intro and outro added, which was kindly donated by slick0. Additionally there is the option to have miniseries where the hosts can have running topics to cover an issue in more detail. A mini series can also be open to so that multiple people can contribute to one topic.


Above all HPR is a Community Network.
