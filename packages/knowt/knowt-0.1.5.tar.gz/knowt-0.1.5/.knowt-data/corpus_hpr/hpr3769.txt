RHEL
Documentation: Creating guests with virt-install

RHEL
9 product documentation list
You can use the virt-install command to create virtual
machines and install operating system on those virtual machines from the
command line. virt-install can be used either interactively
or as part of a script to automate the creation of virtual
machines.

virt-manager

The virt-manager application is a desktop user
interface for managing virtual machines through libvirt. It primarily
targets KVM VMs, but also manages Xen and LXC (linux containers).
virt-install is a command line tool which provides an
easy way to provision operating systems into virtual machines.
virt-viewer is a lightweight UI interface for
interacting with the graphical display of virtualized guest OS. It can
display VNC or SPICE, and uses libvirt to lookup the graphical
connection details.
virt-clone is a command line tool for cloning existing
inactive guests. It copies the disk images, and defines a config with
new name, UUID and MAC address pointing to the copied disks.
virt-xml is a command line tool for easily editing
libvirt domain XML using virt-installâ€™s command line options.
virt-bootstrap is a command line tool providing an easy
way to setup the root file system for libvirt-based containers.

KVM homepage

KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization
solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions
(Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko,
that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor
specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko.
Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified
Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized
hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.

How To Forward a Port.

A port forward is a way of making a computer on your home or
business network accessible to computers on the internet, even though
they are behind a router or firewall. It is commonly used in gaming,
security cameras, home automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
Port forwards are setup in your router. A forwarded port is also known
as open. After you have forwarded a port you have an open port.
