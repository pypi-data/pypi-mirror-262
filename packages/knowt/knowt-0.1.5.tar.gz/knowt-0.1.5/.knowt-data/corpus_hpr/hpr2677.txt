## hpr2677 :: Thoughts on language learning part 4 - RPG.

 I thought I was done with this topic, but got to thinking about bringing a game to life it occurred to me it was a lot of work. So I thought about it some more and hit upon the idea of an RPG probably mostly played online where a key point of the game is that the players needn’t know the same language.
At first this seems like an odd thing for an RPG because the talking to each other is sort of a requirement. By now you’ve guessed that what I mean is that the game could be designed so that it assumes the players will have limited ability to communicate. And that drives how the game progresses.
I see two kinds of approaches. One is that players sort of team up by the their native languages so you might have people knowing different native languages working in smaller teams while the whole game has the goal of everyone learning the new language.
The other is that everyone could know a different native language and many or may nor cooperate with others but the goal of the game is everyone learning the same new language.
Submitting this show mostly because I’m curious what the community thinks of the idea.
