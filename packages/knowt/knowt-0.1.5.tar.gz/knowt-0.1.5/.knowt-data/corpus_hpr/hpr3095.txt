## hpr3095 :: Intro to GIMP

 GIMP is the open source alternative to the proprietary Photoshop, and can do most of the same things while respecting your freedom. This show will kick off a new series of tutorials. As a note of caution, I am not an expert, I am just learning GIMP as I go. But I thought there was no harm in sharing my experiences with the HPR community. https://www.ahuka.com/?page_id=1423
