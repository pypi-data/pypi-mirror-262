## hpr3745 :: Pinecil walkthrough

 Pinecil – a RISC-V powered, open and versatile soldering iron. It can
be  powered via USB-C PD as well as a DC5525 jack, and runs
community developed  software. Moreover, it is compatible with
popular TS-100 tips. All this at half  the price of the
competition.
Pine64 Pinecil
Version

Long press on minus button shows the version  v2.18.A1A569A
17-07-22

Secret setting

Long press on minus button then short press on the plus button shows
the version with the elapsed time the iron is on.

This is is seconds, with the last digit in 100mS increments

example 101 = 10 seconds and 100 milliseconds
