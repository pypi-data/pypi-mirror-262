 Smite, the battleground of the
GODS.
SMITE is a free-to-play online MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)
and ARTS (action real-time strategy) game developed by Titan Forge Games
and published by Hi-Rez Studios. The game is currently available on PC,
Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Players choose from a large
selection of playable gods, immortals, and creatures from ancient
mythology and join session-based arena combat. Each of the playable
characters have their own unique abilities and fighting styles. This
session-based arena combat is mostly 5 players against another set of 5
players, but there are several other Game Modes with different rules and
objectives, and the goal in most of them is to defeat the Titan located
in the opposite team's base while protecting your own Titan.
