Trying to print my Kindle paperwhite stand.

The Taz 3D printer by Lulzbot
The finished Kindle stand:

It worked! Bad part of this design is that it does not accommodate the case that I have on my Kindle, so to use the stand with the Kindle I'll have to remove the case. The next photo shows my son's nook color sitting sideways on it. I might try to modify the design so that it will accommodate the Kindle with its case and also prop it up a bit more vertically. Still, this was a really fun experiment with my first 3d printout.
