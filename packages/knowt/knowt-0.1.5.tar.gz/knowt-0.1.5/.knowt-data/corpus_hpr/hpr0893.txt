 Hacker Public Radio-NYE Part 3 (Everybody loves Crunchbang... except Klaatu)

This is the third part of the Hacker Public Radio New Year's Eve event and you can expect more of them all week long.

Ken Fallon for being Ken Fallon
The Hacker Public Radio Community for coming together and pulling this off, and for making it so much fun for everone. 


I was so wrapped up in the actual show, that it didn't occur to me to take notes and write down the names of all the people who helped us out. The few I listed above are all that I can remember 24 hours later. If you helped out in any way, and would like to be mentioned in the show notes of the remaining parts of this show (there will be a few of them) please email hpr (at) hackerpublicradio (dot) org with your name and I'll be glad to thank you publicly and properly.

Philip Newborough (aka corenominal) project lead for CrunchBang Linux and their community manager Rebecca Newborough join the session. We interviewed them back in hpr0873


CrunchBang is a Debian GNU/Linux based distribution offering a great blend of speed, style and substance. Using the nimble Openbox window manager, it is highly customisable and provides a modern, full-featured GNU/Linux system without sacrificing performance.

In September 2011, Philip gave up paid employment to concentrate on personal projects and is now working full-time on CrunchBang Linux. During the interview he mentioned that he couldn't afford to FOSDEM so if you want you can throw him a few credits over at https://crunchbang.org/donate
