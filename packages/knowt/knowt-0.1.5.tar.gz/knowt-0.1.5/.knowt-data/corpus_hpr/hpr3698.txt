## hpr3698 :: Spectrogram

 Here's a view of my voice. The bright spots at the bottom of the image are my voice, and the bright burst at the top is a click caused by saliva.

Here's me inhaling. Notice how sparse this is compared to my voice.

One thing I fail to mention in the episode is that there are network monitors that render network activity as a spectrogram, too. If you don't have a Wi-Spy, it's worth looking at.
