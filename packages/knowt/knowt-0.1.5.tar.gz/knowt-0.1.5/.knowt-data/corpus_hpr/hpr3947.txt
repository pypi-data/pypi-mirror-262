 Archiving Floppy Disks
Summary
This show describes how I go about archiving old floppy
disks. These disks date back to the early 90s when floppy disks were a
common way of installing software on personal computers. They were
also used as a portable storage mechanism for data files.
Equipment That I'm Using

IBM ThinkCentre desktop computer with a 3.5in floppy disk drive
Installed the 32-bit version of Slackware 14.2

Making an image of an entire floppy disk
dd if=/dev/fd0 of=filename.dsk
Making a floppy disk from a disk image
dd if=filename.dsk of=/dev/fd0
Copy files from a floppy disk

mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
cd /mnt/floppy
cp filename /some/destination/path/filename
cd
umount /mnt/floppy
