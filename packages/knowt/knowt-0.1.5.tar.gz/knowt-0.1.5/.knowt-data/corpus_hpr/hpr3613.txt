## hpr3613 :: Man buys cheap Adirondack chair

 Part C (left front leg), one 30cm piece of unfinished fir, with a sort of fan-shaped piece attached with 2 screws, is duly replaced. The customer has been served. The prize is a wobbly chair and, in a few months time, some firewood. What we learned? I'll build my own chair next time.
