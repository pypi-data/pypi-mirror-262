## hpr0585 :: QSK1: Devil in the Details

 This is the very first episode of the QSK Netcast. I want to thank everyone who supports podcasting, netcasting, Internet broadcasting or whatever you want to call it. I also want to thank all those who believe in Open Source, who strive to mentor with every breath and who believe the world is a better place with more knowledge in it. Please have a listen to my latest effort and send me feedback using the contact form or by leaving comments on the Web site. You can also call the show at 417-200-4811 and press the option for QSK Netcast. I really want to hear from you: Your likes, your dislikes, your requests, your questions--whatever. Just remember, it can only get better from here.
