Pre-Spoilers

Thaj: Great book. Makes me want to go back and re-read the previous book.  I wonder how well some of the commentary  present in this book will resonate in the future.  The story is good enough I have no doubt that it will still be a good read, but I'm not sure if it might loose a bit. 
x1101: I Loved this book. So much so that I listened to it twice. Every chapter is a cliff hanger.
pokey: I LOVE this AudioBook! The author (Lostinbronx) really made me care about each of the characters. Every chapter is a cliff hanger, and that WORKS precisely because I do care about the characters.
pegwole: It was a fantastic post modern essay on life. Even though I listened to the wrong AudioBook.
CrispyoneFifty: Speaking for all of humanity, to all of humanity's future, I say "you should go download and listen to this AudioBook!"

BEVERAGE REVIEWS
As  usual, the HPR_AudioBookClub took some time to review the beverages that each of us were drinking during the episode

Thaj: Running late, just drinking water.  I know LAME!
x1101: Black Isle Organic Oatmeal Stout. Very little head, a cholate/coffee nose, as well as chocolate/coffee malt notes. Not overly fizzy, but not sudsy at all. Excellent. https://www.blackislebrewery.com/beer/Hibernator-Oatmeal-Stout.html
pokey: I drank a Six Star Creatine fruit punch because I'm tired of looking like Ejoq. I have to go to the gym after the show, and this stuff seems to help with muscle recovery. It tastes pretty good. There's no funny artificial sweetener after taste, for which I'm very grateful. https://www.sixstarpro.com/products/creatinex3/
pegwole: It's coffee. Its not a special one either, now shut up.
CrispyoneFifty: Newcastle Werewolf Blood-Red Ale It's sweet up front, and leaves a sweet after taste, with a punch of bitter in between. You can definitely taste the rye in there too. https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/342/71106/
