## hpr2062 :: Now The Chips Are Definitely Down

 
I’d like to start by apologising for the rather fast and excited speaking style of this show particularly towards the end, hope it doesn’t spoil the content too much, it was all done in rather a hurry.
In this show I describe a thought provoking documentary I stumbled upon from 1977, the documentary is about the the silicon chip and explores the far reaching implications it will have on society.
The title for the original documentary was “Now the chips are down”.
I came up with the altered title “Now the chips are definitely down” to signify that not only have the changes already happened but that it’s also had a massive cost reduction impact as my newly purchased piece of equipment demonstrates.
The new piece of equipment that I bought only became so affordable because of the great advances and massive reductions in cost over time. A similar piece of equipment cost me around £120 maybe ten years ago and due to inflation you can probably double the cost again. The price of my new piece of equipment was astonishingly cheap I thought though on reflection its cheap price may also be down to it being a more mass produced item than normal amateur radio equipment.
