## hpr0590 :: QSK Episode 2: MP3 v. OGG

 Thanks to Klaatu for coming on board tonight to talk about the debate over software patents and the MP3 format vs. Open Source audio codecs like OGG. The audio leaves a little bit to be desired but everything is understandable. Please tell everyone about the netcast. Thanks for listening and hope to have you back for Episode 3.
