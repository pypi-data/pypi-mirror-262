## hpr3039 :: Making a Raspberry Pi status display

 Introduction
I have had a project on my To Do list for a while: to make a status display from a Raspberry Pi. My vision was to show the state of various things including some HPR stuff, and I had imagined setting up a Pi with a monitor and controlling it over SSH.
I started on the project over the Christmas period 2019. I have a Raspberry Pi 3A+, which is a sort of souped-up Pi Zero, which I bought on a whim and hadn’t found a use for (Yannick reviewed this RPi model in show 2711). I also had an old square Dell monitor from about 15 years ago which still worked (at least to begin with).
I had imagined I’d write some software of my own with a web front end which ran various tasks to monitor things.
However, in my researches I came across MagicMirror2 which I thought I might be able to use instead of writing my own thing.
