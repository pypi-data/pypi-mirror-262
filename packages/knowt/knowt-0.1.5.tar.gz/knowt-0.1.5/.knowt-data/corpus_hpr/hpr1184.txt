## hpr1184 :: Installing Linux without a monitor

 
Two weeks ago we aired a show about the Sonar Project which is a specialized GNU/Linux distribution to develop and proof accessibility in a modern distribution. This is a test bed and so every single enhancement and discovery will be sent back upstream so that all distributions will be accessible by default.




The Sonar Project show was downloaded a total of 14,219 times so far and yet only 127 people have donated.




Today it's a case of the blind leading the (simulated) blind as Jonathan Nadeau walks pokey through an install of the Sonar GNU/Linux distribution without a monitor.


So listen along and experience what life is like if you are a blind hacker. 
Press PAUSE to hear what it would be like if Jonathan had not done so much work already.
