## hpr3529 :: Linux Inlaws S01E48: Year Two of the Five Year Plan

 Right into the third year of the first five-year plan our two ageing heroes
discuss the past year in review (blatantly stealing this concept from other
popular podcasts), focussing on the hotter episodes of second year and
progress with increasing the number of active listeners from two to five and
beyond. Also, major fuck-ups and lessons learned from them are revealed
including some ranting about badly designed and implemented software never
mind documentation.
