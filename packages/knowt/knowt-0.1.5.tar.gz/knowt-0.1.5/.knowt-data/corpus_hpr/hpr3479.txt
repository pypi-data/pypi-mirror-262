 In this episode our two heroes contemplate the ins and outs of version

is on the newer generation of such as git which enabled large-scale community
projects such as the Linux kernel, programming languages like Rust and Python
and other shenanigans. Including a crash course on version control systems
- you may credits at your local third-level education facility for listening
