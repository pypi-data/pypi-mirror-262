## hpr1514 :: Give The Small Guy A Try

 
Beeza hates being told what to do. When he moved over to Linux he noticed how most users were barely scratching the surface of the huge choice of software offered by the repositories. Rather than just go with the flow and settle for what everybody else was using, it was in his nature to look for alternatives to the most popular applications.


He discovered some total rubbish, but also some real gems which deserve far greater exposure than they receive. Reviews of some of these excellent but relatively unknown packages will form the basis of future HPR episodes.


In this episode Beeza makes the case for investing a little time digging around in the repositories to see if there is software which may suit your requirements better than the mainstream applications.
