## hpr3712 :: The last ever CCHits.net Show

 Over 12 years ago, Jon "The Nice Guy"
Spriggs went to a "Pod Crawl" with (among others) Dave "The Love Bug" Lee, where he
pitched the idea of a daily music promotion show, with a twist - it
would all be automated, and use text-to-speech to introduce
everything.
The first show was released
on 2010-10-24 and the last ever show (this one) was released on
2022-10-12.
Over the twelve years, Jon would go on to meet to meet Yannick and Ken Fallon, both
of whom would go on to shape changes (big and small) to CCHits.
This year, the cracks started to re-appear in the architecture
underneath CCHits - between APIs shutting down that were used to load
tracks to CCHits, and the general framework being used to write CCHits
not receiving the care and attention it needed... and the team finally
decided to stop adding new tracks, and let the process build the last
few shows.
This podcast gives you a peek behind the curtain to the team involved
in the system, and gives you some of the high- and low-lights in the 12
years the site ran for.
