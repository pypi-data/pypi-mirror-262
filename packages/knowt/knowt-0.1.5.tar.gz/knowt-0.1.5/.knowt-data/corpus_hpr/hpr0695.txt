Changes afoot at Binrev

BinRev is our parent site and HPR is hosted on a binrev server.
StankDawg pays the bills for this service and I was tipped off to a post that he made on 23 March 2011 where he notifies us that a server move is on the cards. 
https://www.binrev.com/forums/index.php/blog/1/entry-269-here-we-go-again/


I'm trying to arrange an interview with StankDawg to explain to us what BinRev is and what its goals are.

HPR Appeal

Last month I mentioned that klaatu has not posted a show that month. I was contacted by Karen from the Free as in Freedom oggcast (https://www.faif.us/) to tell me that klaatu had been arrested by the department of immigration while urban camping in some corporate head quarters in Cupertino. She wasn't allowed to say much apart from that the department of homeland security is now involved as well and have confiscated his laptop and are holding him at an undisclosed location. 
We are collecting some money to aid in his release so if you can help please go over and donate at:
