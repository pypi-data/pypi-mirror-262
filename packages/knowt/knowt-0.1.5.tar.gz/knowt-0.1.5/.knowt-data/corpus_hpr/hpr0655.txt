## hpr0655 :: Read 'n Code - 2 Camus's The Plague and Reddit.com

 In this podcast I review the comments I received for the first one as well as bring the good news of the website being complete.

Also, I go over a few quotes from The Plague by Albert Camus and compare it to the popular hacker news website, Reddit.com. More time is spent on the Read part than the Code part, but maybe that will even out in the future. It's easier to cover book quotes than code snippets from Erlang on a podcast.
