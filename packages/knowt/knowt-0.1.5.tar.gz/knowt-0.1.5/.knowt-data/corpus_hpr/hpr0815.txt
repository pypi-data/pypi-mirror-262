 Software Freedom Day Dundee 2011

An event to celebrate and promote the use of free and open source software

Who Are We
"The Open Society" and the "Tayside Linux User Group" have long been establishing their names within the local Free and Open Source Community, as centres of support and advocacy for people from all walks of life. This September we will be showcasing some of the best that our local community has to offer.
What is Software Freedom Day
Software Freedom Day (SFD) is a worldwide celebration of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Our goal in this celebration is to educate the worldwide public about of the benefits of using high quality software in education, in government, at home and in business - in short, everywhere! The non-profit company Software Freedom International coordinates SFD at a global level, providing support, give-aways and a point of collaboration, but volunteer teams around the world organize the local SFD events to impact their own communities.visit softwarefreedomday.org
