## hpr1028 :: Jonathan Kulp and NYbill: Goodwill Hunting 

 
Jonathan Kulp and NYbill talk about a little known resource for inexpensive tech finds. Thanks go to Windigo for the inspiration and episodes title from this dent: 

Jon's export business 

The guys talk about Jon's finds at the Goodwill and his uses of the rigs. As is becoming somewhat of a theme, there is a digression into computer nostalgia and Linux origins. But, the guys get the episode back on track. 

Grab ten bucks and get out there and shop!
