## hpr0644 :: The Plop Boot Loader and UNetbootin- A Great Team

 
Have you ever ran across older computers that did not have BIOS options to boot from USB? Are you tired of burning ISO discs all the time to install an operating system on machines like these? This episode could help you in reducing your collection of ISO discs down to one, and then using a single USB flash drive for all the rest of your needs.
