## hpr3802 :: Attack of the Squishmallow

 Synopsis
In this episode, Rho`n records his attempt to replace a broken MacBook Pro display. Content warning: May cause drowsinessâ€”do not listen while driving or operating heavy machinery. On the other hand, it may be conducive to a good nap in which you drift off to sleep while listening to the introduction and wake up in time to hear how things turn out in the end.
Production notes: The "truncate silence" audio effect in your audio editor is your friend. The original recording length was around 2 hrs and 15 minutes. After truncating the silence it was down to 1 hour and 36 minutes.
