## hpr3300 :: YouTube Channels for Learning Spanish, Part 1

 As I have been learning Spanish I have been making use of a variety of tools and aids. One of the best is YouTube, where there is a wealth of free stuff. Of course, Spanish is not the only language with good resources here, but it is the one I am studying right now. But if you are interested in learning another language, or improving your knowledge of one, you should take a look.
