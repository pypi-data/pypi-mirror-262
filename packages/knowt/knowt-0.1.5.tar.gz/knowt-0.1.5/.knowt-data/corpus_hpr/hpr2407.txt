## hpr2407 :: The Lost Episode Part 2

 A follow up to “The Lost Episode”. Flashing the blank Atmega328p chip to get bring a nonworking Transistor Tester Kit to life.
There are a lot of these kits out there. Different shapes, colors, and capabilities. In my case the kit was called a: 2578AY-AT. The firmware for this particular kit is: mega328_color_kit.

Steps after plugging in the USB programmer:

    lsusb (get bus and device ID numbers.)
    sudo chmod +777 /dev/bus/usb/*bus_ID/*device_ID

    avrdude -c ‘your programmer’ -p ‘your chip’

In my case:

    avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p
Avrdude should communicate with the programmer and verify the chip is ready to receive instructions.
From here Avrdudess helped as I was able to use the ‘verify’ options after a write to see there was an error. Avrdudess also let me correct the error by changing the E-lock value to 0x04. Then the flash would write.
Remember to write the hex file first and the eep file second as hex would over write a eep file if it was written first.
