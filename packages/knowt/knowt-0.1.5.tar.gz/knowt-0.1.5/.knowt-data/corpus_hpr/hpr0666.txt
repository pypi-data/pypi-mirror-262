## hpr0666 :: Salvaging old Coleman lanterns and stoves

 
This show discusses getting neglected lanterns/stoves back into
running condition.  It is not about restoring them to pretty,
like-new, "shelf queen" condition.

errata and clarifications, roughly timecoded

@18mins - The little cup is to hold alcohol, which is burned to "prime"
the system.  The burning alcohol preheats the generator so the higher-
flashpoint kero can ignite without drama.

@19mins -  s/possible/practical/


@20mins - varnish might be removed by sitting in fresh fuel, or more
likely by sitting in 90% isopropyl or methanol.  I filter the alcohol
after use and use it to prime kero gear, as above.


@27mins - the generator can get internally gummed up, particularly when
running unleaded in a unit not designed for that.


@29mins - black _body_ luminosity


@30mins - might want to plug the air tube on a stored suitcase stove
to block the progress of the aforementioned spiders.

@33mins this isn't that unusual;  stove/lantern fettlers skew older, 
demographically speaking
