 Makers on YouTube
Introduction
I have always enjoyed making stuff. I was born and brought up in the 1940’s and 1950’s when the UK was recovering from WW2, and in my experience everyone I knew repaired and made stuff. Most of them grew their own food as well.
I have never been particularly good at making stuff, but I have built some basic furniture, built storage solutions for the house, built a rabbit hutch and run for my children’s pets, and so on and so forth.
In high school, even though I went to a Grammar School, all boys attended mandatory lessons on metalwork and woodwork. We learnt how to use hand tools and some power tools, make joints in wood, we also learnt to do basic metal work like soldering and brazing, and so forth.
Learning this stuff at school was great but I have used the woodworking techniques more than the metalwork - other than soldering.
I stopped watching TV in 2013, preferring reading and listening to podcasts. In recent times I have subscribed to a number of YouTube channels which share woodworking and metalworking techniques and projects. In general these people are Makers and Artists who can turn their hands to many skills. I thought I would share some of my favourites via HPR.
Long notes
I have written out a moderately long set of notes for this episode and these are available here https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr2202/full_shownotes.html.
