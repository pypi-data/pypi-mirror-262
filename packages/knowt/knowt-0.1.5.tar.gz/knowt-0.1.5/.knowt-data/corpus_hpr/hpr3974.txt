## hpr3974 :: About USBimager - part 2/2

 Because you want to make changes on a storage device, you are asked
to enter your password. You can add your user to the group: disk to
avoid this.
who or whoami - my login-name
id - more details
groups - all your groups
less /etc/group | grep disk - focus on disk
Add an existing user to another group, like this:
sudo usermod -aG disk LOGIN-NAME
I saw my entry not immediately check it with:
cat /etc/group

Under releases http://gitlab.com/bztsrc/usbimager
