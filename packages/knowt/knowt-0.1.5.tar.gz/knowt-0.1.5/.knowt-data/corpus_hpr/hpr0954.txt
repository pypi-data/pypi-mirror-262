## hpr0954 :: All Things Chrome

 Cast your minds back to Summer 2011, when Google Plus still looked like a good idea, before the HP Touchpad came and went in a fire sale and before the Euro debt crisis turned into a Keystone Cops movie.
A presenter formerly of this parish, one Ed Hewitt, went out and bought himself a new toy; a Samsung Chromebook. ChromeOS marches on, but for how long? I stand back and referee as Ed and Dave Wilkins, fight it out.
