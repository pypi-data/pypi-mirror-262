## hpr0847 :: FSCONS, MeeGo and the story of Tizen

 Who am i?
Hello everyone, in today's show you will hear my first show on Hacker Public Radio! You may know me as "Seetee", or as "Kenneth from the All In IT Radio podcast", or most likely, you do not know me at all. Hopefully you will hear more shows from me in the future, though.
You find me all over the Internet, and you can follow me at both identi.ca and twitter as @alltinomit
The story in short
At FSCONS 2010 (https://fscons.org/) I had the privilege to watch many interesting talks. Something that really peeked my interest where the talks of Knut Yrvin and Jeremiah Foster, two talented gentlemen who I was lucky to get a little private interview with as well. Their talks are available on Vimeo, and in this episode of Hacker Public Radio you get to hear my interviews, together with my interpretation of what has happened in the past to lead up to the creation of the operating system Tizen.
