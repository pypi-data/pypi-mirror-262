## hpr3780 :: Fediverse Update May 2022

 One of the things I love about the Fediverse is that there is constant activity and development. As I mentioned in the previous report on Bookwyrm, it is not unusual to return to an app a few months later and see new features have been added that make it better. In this report I want to highlight three news stories that I think may be of interest.
