 TGTM Newscast for 2012/02/08 DeepGeek
We have had alot happen in the world since the last newscast, so
let's jump right in! We're also rich in audio interludes, so I will be
inserting them almost between the non-tech news stories.

Here is a news review:

Calls for Julian Assange to be tried as terrorist under NDAA-like law in 2010
This story is important because there was a movement to have multiple political parties in Cuba. Cuba Keeps One Party, Sets Term Limits 

Let's start a segment of three stories regarding United States of America politics. First, a story about the struggle against the "Electoral College" system of voting, which is a key method this country uses to suppress anything besides to two dominant fascist (in the technical sense of being a marriage between corporations and government) parties. We will see how the state of Washington is fighting that system. After this, a story about the fight for decent medical care for the country within the state of California. Lastly, an editorial written by one of the co-chairs of the Socialist Party USA about Ron Paul.

It should be noted that I am not yet "endorsing" the  Socialist Party USA, merely covering their point of view which the corporate media ignores in order to keep them out of the minds of the people of the USA. That's the point of TGTM news, to report the stories they suppress. The Green Party USA is very interesting also.
Jill Stein is fighting for candidacy for President with them, and she recently issued her own "Peoples State of the Union (which I will link to in the "other headlines" section)" right after Obama's State of the Union. While Obama's State Of The Union was very Ronald Regan, you know, with it's tough-guy statements about forcing other countries to respect us via Military Force and it's "trickle down economics" statements about boosting the economy by giving even more handouts to mega-corporations; Jill Stein's message was about "the Green New Deal," about stimulating the economy with direct-to-locality  stimulus. As matter of fact, she held a video chat direct to the people who got to ask her questions via chat room. Remembering that a union I regularly cover, the IWW, encourages it's members to work via worker co-operatives, I asked if co-ops would be locked out of the "Green New Deal." Ms. Stein answered my question by stating that co-operatives were valid recipients of contracts, and that the point was that, historically, big corporations pocket too much for their owners, so she only wanted to lock out the Interstate and large corporations to aid small business units.
Jill Stein is currently running against Roseanne Barr for the candidacy for presidency in the Green Party USA.
