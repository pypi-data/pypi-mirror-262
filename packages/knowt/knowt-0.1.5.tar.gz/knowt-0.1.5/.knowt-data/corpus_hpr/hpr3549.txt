## hpr3549 :: Linux Inlaws S01E51: git and static site generators

  Another fortnight, another episode of our beloved podcast called Linux
Inlaws :-). What starts as an episode on the history of Central Europe and the
role of the Netherlands and Germany in the greater scheme of things rapidly
moves sideways into a discussion of git-powered static HTML website generators
in contrast to context management systems (CMSs) and their advantages,
disadvantages and why the hell even think about this.  Chris uses an innocent
(?) Linux User Group (LUG) as an example for a successful site migration from
a Python-powered CMS to a version of the website based on a static site
generator written in Go and called Hugo.  Even if you may find this boring to
tears stay tuned as there may be an unexpected ending of this ditty in the
shape of two interesting poxes...
