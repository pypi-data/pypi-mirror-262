## hpr1749 :: Scale 13x Part 6 of 6

 
I am 13 years old and live in Santa Barbara. I have participated in the Open Source community for several years. My dad has been on the SCALE leadership team for a long time, and he introduced me to programming. My favorite programming languages are HTML and Javascript with Enyo because I like creating websites and webOS apps. I also program in Shell and some Python, and like making short animations using Blender. I have recently made the world's first emulator for the WITCH, the first currently working fixed-point decimal computer. I recently earned my Technician Amateur Radio license and enjoy attending radio club meetings. Besides geeking, I like to swim, act, and do fun events with the Boy Scouts.
