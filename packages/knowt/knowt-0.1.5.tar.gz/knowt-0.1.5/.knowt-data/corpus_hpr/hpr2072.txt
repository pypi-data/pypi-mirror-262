## hpr2072 :: That Awesome Time I Deleted My Home Directory

 Omg, Sigflup deletes her home directory! Commands in this episode include:



grep -b -a "what you remember" /dev/sd0a > /tmp/log
dd if=/dev/sd0a bs=1 skip=12345 of=/tmp/out count=123456




This is a capture of the program that sigflup recovered. It's a mouth tracker. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2NJrXGT4U
