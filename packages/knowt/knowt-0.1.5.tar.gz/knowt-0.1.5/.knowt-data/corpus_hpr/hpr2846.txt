Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2019-June/thread.html
Events Calendar

Issue with advanced RSS settings
The page at https://www.hackerpublicradio.org/advanced_rss_settings.php describes a series of features that allow the specification of a tailored RSS feed.
One of the features is 'gomax=1' which includes shows in the queue scheduled for the future. For example, the following URL requests 30 OGG format shows including those scheduled for the future:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/rss.php?format=ogg&gomax=1&limit=30
However, there is a problem with this, caused by the way we direct downloads to archive.org. We usually upload the next week’s shows to archive.org, but not all future shows as they arrive. This means that the links to some future shows returned by the feed point to currently non-existent episodes.
This has been the case ever since we moved to using archive.org in this way, in late 2017. We have not received any comments or complaints about it in that time, so the question is:

Does anyone use 'gomax=1'?
