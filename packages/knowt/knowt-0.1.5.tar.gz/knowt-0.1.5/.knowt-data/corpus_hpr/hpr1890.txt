## hpr1890 :: A short walk with my son

 We start the show by saying ta-ra to the wife and daughters and starting on our walk.
Note to self: record an HPR episode about coffee
This episode inspired by jonkulp's emergency HPR episode entitled "biking2work", as mentioned on his GNUsocial post: https://micro.fragdev.com/notice/1425116
I give a brief introduction to who I am, and where I live.

Neewer Lapel Microphones from Amazon UK https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005DOTSM4/
The lapel mic issue at our church. £1.50 a piece, rather than £25+ for an official replacement.

Metric vs Imperial measurements

A comparison between my Nexus 7 and my Olympus DM-3 recorder, both with and without the lapel mic. https://media.thelovebug.org/u/thelovebug/m/lapel-microphone-comparisons/
Small glitch in the recording resulted in about 5 seconds being dropped, so it sounds a little disjointed at one point

Opinion around acceptable audio quality."If you can hear it, it's good enough."

What would happen if Alex slipped and rolled down the hill.Alex gives a quick introduction to himself.He's also the slowest human in history.

I did run this episode through Auphonic, which didn't do a bad job in the slightest.Settings used: Adaptive Leveler, Filtering, Noise and hum reduction set to Auto.According to the processing results, hum reduction wasn't needed.
It would appear as though I've promised Ken 5 new shows - no pressure, eh.
