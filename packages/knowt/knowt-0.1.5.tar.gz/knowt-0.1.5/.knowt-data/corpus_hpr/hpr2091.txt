## hpr2091 :: Everyday Unix/Linux Tools for data processing

 
Here are some of the tools I use to process and clean data from all manner of customers:

detox
The detox utility renames files to make them easier to work with. It removes spaces and other such annoyances. Itâ€™ll also translate or cleanup Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) characters encoded in 8-bit ASCII, Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8, and CGI escaped characters.
See other episodes for great sed information. I like to remove DOS end of line and end of file characters:

sed -i 's/
//g' *.txt
or
sed -i 's/\r//g' *.txt
