## hpr1367 :: I'm Sorry Dan

 
How many times has Dan asked me to run the spec test before pushing code to staging? probably 5. I'm sorry Dan.


The script I used as my pre-commit hook is available at https://hoof.jezra.net/snip/of


Oh, have I ever mentioned how much I dislike convoluted nomenclature?
When I use 'git add', apparently I am adding a file or a change to the 'index',
and it is the index that gets commited when I run 'git commit'
