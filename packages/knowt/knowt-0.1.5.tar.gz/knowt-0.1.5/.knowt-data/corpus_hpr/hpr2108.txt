## hpr2108 :: Changing the Oil on My Wife's Car

 Since people don’t seem to be adding enough shows, you’re going to be subjected to listening along while I change the oil on the car. This might be fascinating or it might be boring, but in either case I hope it inspires someone else to start uploading more shows. Incidentally, I recorded this whole thing on my phone, I’m doing these show notes on my phone, and am going to upload it from my phone as well, without adding the intro and outro music, showing just how easy it really is (as the saying goes).
