## hpr3683 :: Add a favourite to OSMAnd

 I keep forgetting how to add a favorite to OSMAnd, so I've recorded this show to remind myself how to do it.

Search for a location, either in the Hamburger Menu or clicking the Magnifying glass icon
Type in your address and select the place
The screen will appear with a Locator Pin
On the bottom click Add and Save
You can optionally include them in a group
