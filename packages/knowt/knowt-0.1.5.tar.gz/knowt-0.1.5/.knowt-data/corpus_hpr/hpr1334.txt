Welcome to Devpressed 
Anxiety, depression, ADHD, OCD, bipolar, schizophrenia... these are far more prevalent in the developer community than you would believe, but we don't talk about it because of the shame. This forum is a place to share our stories, and help our friends.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE Podcast 
Weekly online podcast interviews with comedians, artists, friends, and the occasional doctor. All exploring mental illness, trauma, addiction and negative thinking.
