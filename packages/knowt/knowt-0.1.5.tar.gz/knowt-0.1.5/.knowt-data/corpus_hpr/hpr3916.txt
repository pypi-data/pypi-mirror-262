Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://lists.hackerpublicradio.com/pipermail/hpr/2023-July/thread.html
Events Calendar
With the kind permission of LWN.net we are linking to
The LWN.net Community Calendar.
Quoting the site:
This is the LWN.net community event calendar, where we track
events of interest to people using and developing Linux and free software.
Clicking on individual events will take you to the appropriate web
page.

The HPR Static Site
As mentioned in the last Community News episode, the HPR database and
website was moved to a new server, and the static site generator written
by Rho`n was used to generated the non-interactive part of
the website.
Since then, there has been a process of adapting the software to the
new configuration. Unfortunately Rho`n has not been
available during this process, but we are gradually learning our way
around his excellent software and making changes to suit our needs.
If you spot any problems or have ideas for new features, please raise
issues on the Gitea repository at: https://repo.anhonesthost.net/rho_n/hpr_generator/issues.
Reserve Queue
A policy change is required in the use of the reserve queue. When
there are unfilled slots between 5 and 7 days in the future, episodes in
this queue will be used to fill them.
This extra time is required because of the time it can take to
process a show and load it to the Internet Archive.
Bram Moolenaar, author of Vim
dies
There was an announcement from Bram's family today (2023-08-05) that
he died on August 3rd 2023 from a medical problem that
worsened recently.
