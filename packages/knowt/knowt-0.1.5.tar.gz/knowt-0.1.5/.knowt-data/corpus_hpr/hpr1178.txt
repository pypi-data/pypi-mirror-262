## hpr1178 :: Interviews with Laura Creighton and Armin Rigo

 Creighton and Rigo about PyPy
"We're really really really really fast." - Laura Creighton (2011)
Today you will hear two interviews, with Laura Creighton and Armin Rigo. You'll get a really unique perspective of Richard Stallman, as well as of the PyPy project. Below you will find links to most of the projects mentioned in the interviews, but first and foremost I would like to recommend you to have a look at Laura's keynote interview "Dialogue with Richard Stallman" and Armin's talk "PyPy".
Make sure you watch the videos from FSCONS2011 with Stallman, Creighton and Rigo!
