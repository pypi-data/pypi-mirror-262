An article that explains how to remove noise using Audacity, which was what dodddummy was talking about when he commented on my first show on HPR2377 https://www.podfeet.com/blog/recording/how-to-remove-noise-with-audacity/
Link to Dave’s (thelovebug) page and the original John Kulp’s $2 microphone show that kicked all this off. Looking forward to getting a chance to catch up with Dave’s drive into work show. Refer to Dave’s episode HPR2400 and John Kulp’s original $2 microphone show HPR1812
