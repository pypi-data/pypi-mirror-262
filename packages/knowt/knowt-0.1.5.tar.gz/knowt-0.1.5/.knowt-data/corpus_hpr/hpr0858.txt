The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments


The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments was a children's chemistry book written in the 1960s by Robert Brent and illustrated by Harry Lazarus and published by Western Publishing in their Golden Books series. Many of the experiments contained in the book are now considered "dangerous for unsupervised children"[citation needed], and would not appear in a modern children's chemistry book[citation needed]. OCLC lists only 126 copies of this book in libraries worldwide.
The book was a source of inspiration to David Hahn, nicknamed "the Radioactive Boy Scout" by the media, who tried to collect a sample of every chemical element and also built a model nuclear reactor, which led to the involvement of the authorities.
