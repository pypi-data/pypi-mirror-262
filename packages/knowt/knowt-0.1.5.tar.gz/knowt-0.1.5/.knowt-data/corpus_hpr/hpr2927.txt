## hpr2927 :: Stardrifter RPG Playtest Part 09

 This episode is Part 9 of the Stardrifter role-playing game playtest. The series is composed of two playtest sessions, held earlier this year. They were recorded and chopped into manageable bites, then edited down into separate episodes.
This series is meant to give listeners some insight into the RPG construction process. Playtesting is not the final step, but rather, just another stage. The construction of an RPG can be convoluted, and feedback from players is absolutely vital.
In this part, the characters agree to join someone elseâ€™s treasure hunt, with the success (or failure) of their own mission in the balance!
Special thanks to my playtesters: Thaj, Mark (who was playing Brinn), and X1101!
