In todays episode Ken interviews Dave Yates of the Southeast LinuxFest.
The Southeast LinuxFest is a community event for anyone who wants to learn more about Linux and Free & Open Source software. It is part educational conference, and part social gathering. Like Linux itself, it is shared with attendees of all skill levels to communicate tips and ideas, and to benefit all who use Linux/Free and Open Source Software. LinuxFest is the place to learn, to make new friends, to network with new business partners, and most importantly, to have fun!
The third annual Southeast LinuxFest is scheduled for June 10-12, 2011 in Spartanburg, SC.
