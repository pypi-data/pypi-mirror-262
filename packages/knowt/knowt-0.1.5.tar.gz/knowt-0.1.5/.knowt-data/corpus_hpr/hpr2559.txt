On Android, I'm lazy and just seem to have fallen into using the chrome browser. The Add-on I'm going to talk about unfortunately isn't available for the Android operating system.
On the Linux desktop, I use Firefox
In the past, I've dabbled with various browser add-ons but until very recently I've been using no browser add-ons on the desktop.
A browser add-on I did use and did miss was Tab groups
Tab Groups was originally a feature built into Mozilla Firefox
The feature was removed but maintained as an add-on until it was broken by changes in Firefox 57

A colleague at work brought the One-Tab add-on to my attention https://www.one-tab.com/
It's available for both the Chrome browser and Firefox
No sign-up or registration required
With Tab-group I found myself spending a lot of time arranging groups getting the size right naming them etc.
One tab philosophy is a bit different and perhaps maybe not so intuitive, though I think now after some use I prefer it as it gets out of the way and can be used with the minimal of fuss.
I highly recommend one-tab if you regularly find yourself dealing with a lot of open tabs in your browser.
