## hpr1517 :: The set of prime numbers is infinite

 
In this short article I want to talk about prime numbers. In particular:
about the fact that there exist an infinite number of prime numbers. This
has been proven more than 2000 years ago, but I noticed that a lot of
my friends that don't have a mathematical background, aren't aware of
this fact.


Yet it is rather easy to prove. So that is what I'll be doing in this
article. If you are afraid of math, don't worry, it won't take more than
10 minutes.
