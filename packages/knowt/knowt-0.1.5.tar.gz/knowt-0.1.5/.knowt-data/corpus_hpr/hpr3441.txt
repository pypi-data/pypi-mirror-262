## hpr3441 :: Murphy Work Bench

 
PROS:

easy clean up just fold and vacuum
height is great for tall people so I'm not hunched over the table
saves space

CONS:

I ran into it 2 times so I rounded the edges
I just now hit my head on it ... folded and crashed everything on the table to the ground and pic I custom made fell of the wall and into my AC water bucket
loud when using and setting up everything echoes though the walls at night etc
