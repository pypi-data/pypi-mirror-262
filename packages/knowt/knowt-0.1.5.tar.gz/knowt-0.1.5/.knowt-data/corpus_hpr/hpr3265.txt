## hpr3265 :: My Chromebook Experience

 On January 5, 2021, Zen_Floater2 did an interesting show that you might call a virtual conversation with Klaatu. He took a show that Klaatu had done on the GNU World Order podcast about using Chromebooks, and interspersed his own comments. As I was listening I thought that I had a slightly different perspective, so I recorded this brief show about my own experience.
