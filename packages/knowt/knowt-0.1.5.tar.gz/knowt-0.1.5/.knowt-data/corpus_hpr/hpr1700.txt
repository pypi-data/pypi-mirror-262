## hpr1700 :: Today with a Techie episode two thousand

 Hacker Public Radio (HPR) is an Internet Radio show (podcast) that releases shows every weekday Monday through Friday. HPR has a long lineage going back to Radio FreeK America, Binary Revolution Radio & Infonomicon, and it is a direct continuation of Twatech radio. Please listen to StankDawg's "Introduction to HPR" for more information.
Knowing how much I hate editing, I hope everyone can get a sense for how much I appreciate all the people who took the time to contribute to the project.
