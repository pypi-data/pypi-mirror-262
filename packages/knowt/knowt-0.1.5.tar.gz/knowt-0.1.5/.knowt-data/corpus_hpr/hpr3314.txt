## hpr3314 :: Introduction... A little bit about me

 Inoffensive in every region of the world. Meeting me is a completely different story.
Name is Trey. I have been listening to HPR for about a year and after hearing repeated pleas for episodes, I thought I would record some of my own.
I cannot guarantee quality of production nor content, but I hope you find them entertaining.
This episode is simply an introduction with a little bit of information about me
My love of computers began 40 years ago when my parents scrimped and saved to purchase a Texas Instruments TI-99/4a computer. I began programming in BASIC, saving programs to audio cassette tapes. I remember buying magazines to get new programs to enter, save, edit, and turn into something different.
Soon I expanded the computer to include 32K of RAM and an RS232 card which allowed me to connect a 300 BAUD modem and connect to bulletin board systems (BBS). BBS became my connection to the world.
I later upgraded to a Commodore 64, which gave me a floppy disk. Much faster than saving to tape. I studied electronics & computers in college, then went to work for a large computer vendor, traveling all over fixing computers, networks, and peripherals.
After about a decade, I joined a different company where I worked in systems administration and engineering, with a focus on information security. I have worked as security analyst, incident responder, security engineer, and security architect, then built out and managed the SOC for a large organization.
Today, I am still focused on information security and I also dabble in clock repair, Ham radio, electronics, and photography. I may record some episodes on some of these topics in the future.
Thank you for listening to me prattle on about myself, and have an awesome day.
