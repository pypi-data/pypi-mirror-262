## hpr3116 :: Unscripted ramblings on a walk:  Crisis at The Manor

 In an episode years ago, I talked about "libernil.net" (a network for my family and friends). That network grew to be known as "The Manor" (manor.space) and has hosted more friends over time. Not too long ago our primary infrastructure was knocked out by lightning. On today's walk, I talk a little bit about what happened.
