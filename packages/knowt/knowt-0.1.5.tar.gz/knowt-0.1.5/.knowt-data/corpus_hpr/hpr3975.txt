## hpr3975 :: Mesa Verde 20230618

 We had occasion to travel to Colorado for a wedding, and took a
little extra time to visit Mesa Verde. This is a site originally
inhabited by the Puebloan people (as the Spanish called them) that was
located on a Mesa in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains. The site is
not far from New Mexico, and our tour was fascinating, so I am sharing
it with you.
