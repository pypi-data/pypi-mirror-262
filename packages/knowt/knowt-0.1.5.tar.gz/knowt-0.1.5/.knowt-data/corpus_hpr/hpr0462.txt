 The main feature of this episode is a software review of "Lyx," the document processor. A "not a word processor" front end to the powerful Latex typesetting environment, and multiplatform too.
Deepgeek also offers updates on his "Beowulf cluster" and "Running Linux on Compact Flash" episodes of HPR.
Closing music is "Sevish - Consciousness."
