## hpr3167 :: A ramble with the Pentland Squires (part 1)

 Introduction
Once again the two HPR hosts based in Edinburgh got together over Mumble to have a chat during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MrX
Dave Morriss

We recorded this conversation in the evening of Sunday 23rd August 2020.
The audio was quite long when we’d finished, so we decided to cut it into two similar-length pieces and the remainder is released as a second episode.
Show title
Although a explaining a joke can often destroy it, it’s probably worth saying that the title of this show was derived from the name of a variety of potato, Pentland Squire, and the fact that the two participants were separated by the Pentland Hills in Edinburgh! "Where was the joke?" you ask…
Notes
Some of the topics we discussed:

Our positions relative to the Pentland Hills: MrX is to the East and Dave is to the West of the area, which is to the south of Edinburgh, about 6 or 7 miles out.
