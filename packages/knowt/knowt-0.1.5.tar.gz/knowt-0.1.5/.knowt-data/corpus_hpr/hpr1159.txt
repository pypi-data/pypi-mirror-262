## hpr1159 :: Food - Health - Nutritionally Dense food

 Part 1 of ...I Love Food, Good Food

A Contribution for HPR from Dude-man@dudmanovi.cz where he talks about a not so well known, but very well thought out and backed up by scientific research started in the 1930's by Weston A Price, who went on after traveling around the world to find healthy people and study what made them healthy to write a large book describing in a language understandable to the lay person what he discovered along with its significance in our own lives should we wish to maximize our health and that of our children and future generations. Of course the first question we should have is what does a healthy person look like, the shape and size, the condition of the teeth etc.


Dude-man does his best to share a little of what he's learnt over the last 10 years which he's been putting into practice with his wife, son (7), daughter (2) and their small homestead of Jersey dairy cows and other animals which help provide the staff of life to the whole family.
