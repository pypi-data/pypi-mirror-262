## hpr3219 :: Linux Inlaws S01E18: Voice Recognition and Text to Speech

 
In this episode, Chris is harassed by quite a few artificial nuisance callers, among
drug lords, Irish nurses and some random Linux Inlaws Chief Financial Officer. Based
on these examples, our two heroes discuss the history and current state of text-to-
speech (TTS) and voice recognition. We attempted to use voice recognition software in order
to produce a transcript of the show.
