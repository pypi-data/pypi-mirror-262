## hpr3133 :: Quick tip - Using MPV with Youtube links

 Idea:
Quickly copy a Youtube or other video site, and open in the MPV media player.
Plugins:
Vim Vixen for Firefox
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen
Surfingkeys for Chrome/Chromium browser
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/surfingkeys/gfbliohnnapiefjpjlpjnehglfpaknnc?hl=en-US
Script:
#!/bin/bash
## mpvurl

url=`xsel -o -b`
echo $url
mpv $url
Rename /usr/bin/vlc to /usr/bin/vlc.old
Copy script to /usr/bin/vlc and chmod +x /usr/bin/vlc
How to use:
Vim Vixen copy is 'y' Surfingkeys copy is 'yy'
Shortcut to open copied video url is Shift-Mod-p, with Mod being the windows key
Tested with Gnome3, Xfce and i3
In i3, press Mod+v then Mod+s.
Any video played this way will be stacked under Firefox/Chromium for the rest of your session.
Config:
In ~/.config/i3/config
#Paste url into mpv player
bindsym $mod+Shift+p exec vlc

For Gnome3 the setting can be reached with Mod (Windows key) and Shortcuts

And the Default Applications need to be changed

The setting for Shortcuts in Xfce looks like this
