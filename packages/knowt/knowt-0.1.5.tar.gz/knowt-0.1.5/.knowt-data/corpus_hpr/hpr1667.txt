## hpr1667 :: How to start a Blog

 
So you want to start a blog?


Here are some of the tings to think about:


Why do you want to do a blog?

What do you want to say?

Who are your audience?

Do you mean to promote the blog to a wider audience or do you just want to write?



There are a number of popular and well known blogging engines and 
services, these are just some of them:


Wordpress: https://wordpress.com/

Drupal: https://www.drupal.org/

Livejournal: https://www.livejournal.com/



Nikola is an excellent system for creating a web-site that includes 
both static pages and a blog.  It has been covered before on HPR and 
it was that show that started me using it.
