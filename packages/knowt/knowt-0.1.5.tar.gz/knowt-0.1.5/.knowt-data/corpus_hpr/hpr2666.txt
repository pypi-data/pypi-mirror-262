## hpr2666 :: Slackware Post-Install

 This episode started out as just some thoughts on why I decided to move back to Slackware after having been away from it for a few years, and wound up being a short set of notes on the post install configuration of Slackware 14.2
This is by no means a definitive or exhaustive in its scope. It’s just a few thoughts and tips on the post-install process that might not be completely clear to a new user.
