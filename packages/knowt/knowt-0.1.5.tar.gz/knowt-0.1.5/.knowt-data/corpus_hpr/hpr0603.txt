## hpr0603 :: QSK Episode 4: AM vs. FM

 After a discussion on IRC that I've had several times before over the past few years, I decided to put my thoughts on the difference between AM and FM radio into a podcast. This talk gets a little bit technical but I think it's easy enough for the average listener to follow. Thank you, Linux Basement, for mentioning the show. I really appreciate it!
