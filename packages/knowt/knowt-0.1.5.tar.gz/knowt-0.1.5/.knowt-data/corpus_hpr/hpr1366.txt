## hpr1366 :: What I do with my Raspberry Pi

 
Use case 1: Astronomy computer


Dobsonian telescope https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian_telescope


Kstars desktop planetarium and star chart program (should be in most distributions repositories as one of the KDE education packages) https://edu.kde.org/kstars/


The Messier catalog https://messier.seds.org/
The Messier marathon https://messier.seds.org/xtra/marathon/marathon.html


Texas Star Party amateur telescope making page https://texasstarparty.org/activities/atm/2013-2/ my entry is about 2/3s of the wat down the page and you can see the Motorola lapdock mounted on my 20 inch (50.8 cm) dobsonian telescope on the right of the photo (the Raspberry Pi is behind the screen of the lapdock).  The whole telescope isn't shown, it's about 9 feet (2.75 meters) tall.


Use case 2: Home server

Rsync programs I'm using on Android
Botsync SSH SFTP https://botsync.com/ simple to setup
Rsync backup for Android https://android.kowalczuk.er/rsync4android/ full featured and uses dropbear ssh keys for authentication.  Between recording the audio and writing the show notes, I switched completely to using Rsync backup to sync my podcasts to my Galaxy S4 phone


Not mentioned on the podcast but the audio player I'm using on Android is Music Folder Player https://sites.google.com/site/zorillasoft/
