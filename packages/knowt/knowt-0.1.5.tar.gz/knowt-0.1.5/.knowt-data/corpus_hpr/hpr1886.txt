## hpr1886 :: Moral Volcano's Linux Tips & Tricks podcast for Hacker Public Radio

 
Welcome to my first podcast for Hacker Public Radio. 


Like Gnome 3? Good for you.

Don't like Gnome 3 or like Gnome 2 more? Then, get a Linux distro with the Mate desktop. Mate desktop was forked from Gnome 2. Gnome 2 development was stopped by the Gnome 3 team.
After installing the Mate desktop, install the Nimbus theme and Compiz desktop effects.

   I don't have the 32-bit edition.

Have a USB wireless modem? Use wvdial or gnome-ppp with "stupid mode" enabled.
Change gnome-terminal color scheme to Green-On-Black and the the following line to your .bashrc for a colorful and usable terminal window.
   PS1="\a\n\n\e[31;1m\u@\h on \d at \@\n\e[33;1m\w\e[0m\n$ "

Install CMU fonts from
https://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/~panov/cm-unicode/
Download Google fonts using this bash script
   wget https://googlefontdirectory.googlecode.com/hg/ofl/ -r -nc -nd -np -A.ttf
   This command takes a while to parse all the pages and find the fonts that need to be downloaded.

Firestarter firewall - I think it needs only a little attention from Linux developers before it can be extremely useful again. Most of it still works.
