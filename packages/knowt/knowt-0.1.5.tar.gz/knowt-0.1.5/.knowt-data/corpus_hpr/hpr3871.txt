Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2023-May/thread.html
Events Calendar
With the kind permission of LWN.net we are linking to
The LWN.net Community Calendar.
Quoting the site:
This is the LWN.net community event calendar, where we track
events of interest to people using and developing Linux and free software.
Clicking on individual events will take you to the appropriate web
page.
Any other business
Server move
We are currently in the process of moving the HPR server. A server
has been set up on Amazon AWS, and we are currently setting up a copy of
the database, mail system and Mailman mailing list service.
The Gitea Git repository has already been moved and is in
use. The static site created by rho`n is being set up to
provide the main HPR website. Work is being done to provide the
interactive facilities that need the database, such as show and comment
submission.
Contacting old hosts
The rate of show submission is unusually low this year. The number of
active contributors is low too, with a small group of hosts keeping the
HPR project from sinking below the waves.
A question for the HPR Community - can we contact old hosts to ask
them to contribute again?
Conversion
of Windows-1252 characters to UTF-8 Unicode
As mentioned on the last Community News the Windows-1252
characters (aka Latin1) in the database were converted to the
UTF-8 Unicode format apparently without exceptions. If anyone finds any
unexpected characters in episode titles, summaries, tags or notes from
now onwards please let us know and we'll fix them too!
