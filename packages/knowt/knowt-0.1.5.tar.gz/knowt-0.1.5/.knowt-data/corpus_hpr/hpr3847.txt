## hpr3847 :: All about Synchrotrons

 I moved cities a few years ago to start work at the Australian
Synchrotron. While I'm always going to be a software engineer, and I'm
never going to be on top of all the science aspects of a synchrotron, I
probably now know enough to be able to put together a series all about
synchrotrons.
