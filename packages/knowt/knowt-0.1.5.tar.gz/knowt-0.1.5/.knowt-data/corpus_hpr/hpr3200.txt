## hpr3200 :: Better Social Media 17 - OcapPub

 Social media has some problems, and even federated media is not immune to them. OcapPub proposes to help reduce some problems by moving away from a fundamentally broken model revolving around identity and access to a better model involving objects and capabilities. This could help reduce to problems of identity theft, and help against web site problems like clickjacking and Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a proposal being worked on, not a finished technology, but it is promising.
