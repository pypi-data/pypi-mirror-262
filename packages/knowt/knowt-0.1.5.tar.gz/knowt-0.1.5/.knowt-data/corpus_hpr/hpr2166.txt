## hpr2166 :: How to use a Slide Rule

 How to use a Slide Rule
In my show 1664, “Life and Times of a Geek part 1”, I spoke about using a slide rule as a schoolboy. As a consequence, I was asked if I would do a show on slide rules, and this is it (after a rather long delay).
Long notes
I have written out a moderately long set of notes for this episode and these are available here https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr2166/full_shownotes.html.
