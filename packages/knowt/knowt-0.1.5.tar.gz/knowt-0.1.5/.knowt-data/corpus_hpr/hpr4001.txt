New Year's Eve show
As is now traditional on HPR, there will be a recording made on
Mumble where interested parties may come together to chat. Details will
be made available on the website soon, but if you want to join in, the
official times will be:
Start at:     Sunday 2023-12-31 10:00 +0000
End at:       Monday 2024-01-01 12:00 +0000
Static Site

In November we finally seem to have perfected the algorithm for
computing the days to the next free slot! The index page contains
the result of this, used in the sentence:

If you record your show now it could be released in
X days.

It initially proved to be difficult to achieve this using a
combination of database and template computations. The lessons have been
learnt (hopefully).
