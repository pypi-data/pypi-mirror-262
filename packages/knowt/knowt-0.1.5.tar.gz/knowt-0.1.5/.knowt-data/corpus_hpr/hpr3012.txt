## hpr3012 :: Sample episode from Wikipediapodden

 
Jan Ainali from the  https://wikipediapodden.se/ podcast came over to the https://freeculturepodcasts.org/ booth at FOSDEM 2020.


They do a Swedish Language Podcast about wikipedia et al, and of course we added them to the https://freeculturepodcasts.org/ site. While their main shows are in Swedish, they also have summaries that they do in English which can be found at https://wikipediapodden.se/tag/english/, (RSS Feed).
