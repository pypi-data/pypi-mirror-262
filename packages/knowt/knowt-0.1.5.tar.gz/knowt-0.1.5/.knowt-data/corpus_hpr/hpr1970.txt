## hpr1970 :: How I got started with Linux

 
This story begins at the beginning of 2010.  I was broke at the time so I was trying to find a free operating system. I needed something I could run on my PC’s at home. I had searched on the Internet, but found nothing useful for a long time. But one day  I was at Barnes and Noble and I saw a magazine for Linux. (While I had heard of linux before I never thought of it as something I would ever be able to use.) When I asked people who I knew were computer professionals, I was told it was for people that were experts, and difficult to use. I never heard anything positive about it. I am so amazed that I hadn’t came across it sooner.
When I read the magazine I became exposed to Ubuntu 9.10.  Karmic Koala. It sounded so good, as if it was exactly what I was looking for. As a result, I got very excited took it home, and to my surprise had such an easy time installing it to my PC that I decided to run it along with Windows XP as a dual boot system. All I did was put the live CD in the drive and the instructions were step by step you would have to be pretty slow to not get how to set things up.
Since then I have been very satisfied with Ubuntu in general and I have been able to check out later versions of it such as 10.04 (Maverick Meerkat) and 10.10 Lucid Lynx. I am looking forward to 11.04 Natty Narwhal for how it integrates multi-touch even more than 10.04.  This experience just goes to show once again how I  manage to find the coolest stuff by accident.
I will keep you posted on how I learn and grow with the different distros available so keep posted.
