## hpr1770 :: The OpenDyslexic Font

 In this episode I talk about how you can take advantage of the OpenDyslexic font as a user, and also how as a content provider you can use it to help your readers. Incidentally, we also talked about this for a while during episode 1418, one of the 2013 New-Year shows.
