## hpr1250 :: Interview With YTCracker

 
This is an interview with YTCracker, one of my favorite NerdCore rappers. You can find links to his music on his website https://www.ytcracker.com/


If you like Nerdcore Rap, a good website to check out is https://nerdcorenow.com. They have a few "various artists" compilation albums available for download. 


Thanks to my guest, YTCracker for coming on Hacker Public Radio, and thank you for listening.
