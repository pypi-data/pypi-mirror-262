Enforcement Division. DMV special agents have offices inside the
customer service centers where they respond immediately to concerns,
such as individuals who attempt to pass counterfeit documents. Their
presence serves not only to deter attempts of criminal activity, but
also to facilitate partnerships with DMV customer service
representatives as a first line defense in the detection of fraudulent
documents and apprehension of offenders. Field Investigations agents
also are charged with enforcing the Virginia Code section intended to
protect Virginia consumers from unsafe vehicles and vehicle fraud
arising from the illegal sale of vehicles without the required business
and motor vehicle dealer licenses, safety inspections, warranties,
titling, or taxes. This statute also protects licensed motor vehicle
dealers from unfair and illegal competition and ensures that the state
and localities collect appropriate revenues.
