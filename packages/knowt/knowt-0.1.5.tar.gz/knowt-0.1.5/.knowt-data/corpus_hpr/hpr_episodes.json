Think, hacking, phone preaking, politics, survival, caffeine, linux, movie reviews, game reviews, etc. There is no restriction on the length but the shows will have the intro and outro added, which was kindly donated by slick0. Additionally there is the option to have miniseries where the hosts can have running topics to cover an issue in more detail.

At the time of its introduction in late 2007, it was noted for its combination of a lightweight, Linux-based operating system, solid-state drive (SSD), and relatively low cost. Newer models added the options of Microsoft Windows operating system, rotating media hard disk drives (HDD) and initially retailed for up to 500 euro.\nThe first Eee PC was a milestone in the personal computer business, launching the netbook category of small, low cost laptops in the West (in Japan, subnotebooks had long been a staple in computing). According to Asus, the name Eee derives from \"the three Es\", an abbreviation of its advertising slogan for the device: \"Easy to learn, Easy to work, Easy to play\".\nIn January 2013, Asus officially ended production of their Eee PC series due to declining sales as a result of consumers favoring tablets and Ultrabooks over netbooks.
