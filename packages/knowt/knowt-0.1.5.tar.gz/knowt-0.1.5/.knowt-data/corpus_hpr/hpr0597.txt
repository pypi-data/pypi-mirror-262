## hpr0597 :: QSK Episode 3: Old and in the Way

 QSK: Episode 3 of QSK is a rantcast. Cheryl, my significant other, and I ruminate on the state of motor vehicle licensing in the world, how ridiculous the situation has gotten and what we're planning on doing about it.  This one is a fun ride, so sit back and enjoy the total lack of political correctness. We did.
