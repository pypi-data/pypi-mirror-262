## hpr3681 :: Rust 101 Episode 3: Functionally Insane

 In this episode BlacKernel is back! (Although a lot more loopy than I remember being while recording)
And teaching you how to make functions, for loops, and match statements in Rust.
Points covered in this episode:

isize and usize number types in rust
fn (function) declarations with arguments and return types
match statements both bare and part of variable assignment
for _ in 1..x loops. That is for loops over an iterator variable across a range of integers.
