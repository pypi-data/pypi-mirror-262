Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2021-July/thread.html

Older HPR shows on archive.org
This month 35 additional shows in the range 1-870 have been uploaded.
Since we don't want to upload shows without summaries or tags the old shows and tag and summary projects are now tied together. So we will be all the more welcoming of tag and summary updates submitted as described on the summary page.
Tags and Summaries
Thanks to the following contributors for sending in updates in the past month:
Archer72, Rho`n, Dave Morriss
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 71 shows which were without them.
There are currently 222 shows which need a summary and/or tags.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
