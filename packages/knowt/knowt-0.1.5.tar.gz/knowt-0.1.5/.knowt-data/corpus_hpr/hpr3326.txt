Older HPR shows on archive.org
The project to upload the older HPR shows to archive.org has been quiescent for a few years. The shows between 1 and 870 had not been uploaded prior to April 2021 (though some shows had been uploaded in batches in the early days, without notes etc).
However, this old show project has been restarted this month, after new software had been written to help manage the process. At the time of writing 65 shows in the range 1-870 have been uploaded, with notes, and with the same range of audio formats used for current shows.
Since we don't want to upload shows without summaries or tags the two projects are now tied together. So we will be all the more welcoming of tag and summary updates sent to the address referenced in the next section!
The plan is to report the numbers uploaded each month in the AOB section of the Community News show notes.
HPR shows on archive.org have the URL https://archive.org/details/hprXXXX where XXXX is the show number with leading zeroes. So for example, show 840's URL is: https://archive.org/details/hpr0840.
Tags and Summaries
Thanks to the following contributors for sending in updates in the past month:
Dave Morriss, Windigo
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 23 shows which were without them.
There are now 384 shows which need a summary and/or tags.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
