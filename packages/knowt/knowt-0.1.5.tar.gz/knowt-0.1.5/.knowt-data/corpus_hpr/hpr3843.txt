## hpr3843 :: LinuxLUGCast pre-show ramblings

 I first want to apologize for my crappy show notes.
That out of the way. Welcome to LinuxLUGCast episode 217 the
pre-show. Normally this gets tacked on to the end of the regular
podcast, but Ken put out a call for shows and we figured this was the
easiest way to get a show out. I was going to try to meet up with these
same people on Mumble and talk about something technical for HPR, but
let's be honest the conversation would probably still have turned into
TV and movies, and we were already together and recording. Plus
hopefully I can use this to convince other people to come and join the
Lugcast. We record every first and third Friday of the month using
mumble. Check out linuxlugcast.com for all the details.
