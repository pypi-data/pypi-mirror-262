Honza Kral takes some time out to chat with us about the Elasticsearch ELK Stack. 

Honza Kral from Elasticsearch

By combining the massively popular Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana we have created an end-to-end stack that delivers actionable insights in real-time from almost any type of structured and unstructured data source. Built and supported by the engineers behind each of these open source products, the Elasticsearch ELK stack makes searching and analyzing data easier than ever before.

00:33:25 LibreOffice

We have a great conversation with Cor Nouws, who proves that you can earn a living supporting Free Software.

The hard working Libreoffice booth team

LibreOffice is the most widely used free open source office software. It is a community-driven project of The Document Foundation. LibreOffice is developed by professionals and by users, just like you, who believe in the principles of free software and in sharing their work with the world in a non-restrictive way. At the core of these principles is the promise of better-quality, highly-reliable and secure software that gives you greater flexibility at zero cost and no end-user lock-in. LibreOffice works natively with the Open Document Format, but also brings you support for by far the most file types for office-documents. It comes with support for over 80 languages and with a whole amount of other unique features to work with your texts, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings and data.

01:05:30 XMPP realtime lounge

Lights, Sensors, Switches, Dimmers and of course the obligatory RaspberryPi and a bread board. So what is this you ask ? Well Ralph Meijer, Edwin Mons and Joachim Lindborg explain the "Internet of things" and how they want to use the XMPP protocol to "chat" with your devices. The plan is simple: set-up each device so it can talk to XMPP, then you can use Jabber or any other XMPP client to talk to them.

The lads from the XMPP realtime lounge

The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data. The technology pages provide more information about the various XMPP “building blocks”. Several books about Jabber/XMPP technologies are available, as well.
