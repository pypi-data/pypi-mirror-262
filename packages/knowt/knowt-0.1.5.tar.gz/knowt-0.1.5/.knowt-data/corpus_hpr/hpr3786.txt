Show transcripts
Transcripts of audio have been generated for shows since December
2022, using the Whisper tool.
Ken Fallon has been working on this project, and has also been
transcribing the older shows from hpr0001 to the present
day. This part of the project is complete.
The transcripts have been attached to each show on the HPR website,
and are in the process of being added on archive.org.

This "re-upload" project
is now ended. All shows from 871 to 2429 have been re-uploaded with all
audio files and other assets.
