credentials from a webpage HTML inline frame.
wikipedia:
An inline frame places another HTML document in a frame. Unlike an
<object /> element, an <iframe> can be the "target" frame
for links defined by other elements, and it can be selected by the user
agent as the focus for printing, viewing its source, and so on. The
content of the element is used as alternative text to be displayed if
the browser does not support inline frames. A separate document is
linked to a frame using the src attribute inside the <iframe />,
an inline HTML code is embedded to a frame using the srcdoc attribute
inside the <iframe /> element. First introduced by Microsoft
Internet Explorer in 1997, standardized in HTML 4.0 Transitional,
allowed in HTML5.
