## hpr2270 :: Managing tags on HPR episodes - 3

 Managing tags on HPR episodes - 3
Introduction
This is the third (and last) show looking at the subject of Managing Tags relating to HPR shows.
In the first show we looked at why we need tags, and examined the advantages and disadvantages of the present system of storage. We considered the drawbacks of this design when searching the tags.
Then in the second show we looked at a simple way of making a tags table and how to query it in order to fulfil the requirements defined in the first show.
In this show we’ll look at a more rigorous, efficient, “normalised” solution.
Long notes
I have written out a set of longer notes for this episode and these are available here.
