## hpr2032 :: How I Came to Linux

 I tell the story of how I learned about computers and eventually came to be an avid Linux user.
I've been using Linux as my primary operating system for almost 20 years now. My primary distribution of choice has always been Slackware, but I have branched out to some more "modern" distributions as well, particularly for workstation environments.
I have been an HPR listener now for several months and this is my first show. I enjoy the podcast very much and hope to see it continue for many more years. Thank you to the administrators and leaders to make it all possible. And, of course, thank you to everyone that contributes shows.
