I beg to differ :).


This show was recorded on Audacity using a Logitech headset.


In episode hpr1892 :: my chicken coop jezra went to great lengths to protect his chickens. His system based on a BeagleBone Black ensures the door opens and closes only during the day. 


In this show jezra explains how he gets the system to send him an email, and a text message using mailx and his phones providers free SMS to Email gateway.
