## hpr1060 :: OggCamp12 Farewell

 
I was leaving my hotel room after the end of OggCamp, thinking to myself I had enough interviews recorded and something made me go back and get my recorders. I'm glad I did as I bagged some fantastic interviews. 


The first one was with Rebecca Newborough web mistress of the Lincoln LUG https://lincoln.lug.org.uk/ on how to start a LUG. The first step is to visit the UK Linux User Groups site at https://lug.org.uk/


We all went to the Leaf venue for food and conversation https://thisisleaf.co.uk/#/on-bold-street/, while there I interviewed a few gentlemen starting with Kris Findlay about changes at his LUG and his work at  Krisilis IT Solutions www.krisilis.com
Raspberry Pi GPIO Demo https://www.slideshare.net/azmodie/introduction-to-raspberry-pi-and-gpio
    Introduction to Raspberry Pi and GPIO  from Kris Findlay 

Video on youtube (should also play after slide 14 on slideshare)

The Software Society https://www.thesoftwaresociety.org.uk


Then we had a chat with Ian Closs over from Ireland. We discussed the local FLOSS scene, Mark Shuttleworth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth who will be attending SkyCon  https://skycon.skynet.ie/2012/ and Archeology.


To round it all off a long round up with Fabian A. Scherschel https://sixgun.org/fabsh/ who true to his word gave me an interview for HPR. Of course he is still on record to submit a show to HPR himself.


You might think that's the end of OggCamp but I still have shows from last year to post :)
