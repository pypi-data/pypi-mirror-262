 Accessibility,
and Navigating the HPR Web Pages with a Screen Reader
Some time in the last year there has been some discussion on the HPR
mailing list about some of the problems I was having, particularly with
the tags page, on the HPR site.
Here is a show in which you can hear both me and my screen reader, as
I navigate the HPR home page, and then the HPR tags page.
Dave Morriss has made a nice job of fixing the issues I had, and made
the tags page a lot more friendly for blind and visually impaired
users.
It's quite a long podcast, and it took a lot of editing. So most of
the polish wore off by the time I 'finished' it and decided enough was
enough.
