## hpr3637 :: HPR feed to Sqlite

 
Mailing list discussion - Source Code for the HPR website

What are the best ways to reproduce the HPR site using a static site generator.
I would like the DB to be made public, but I understand why that may not be possible


One interesting thing I read during the discussion is Ken said Every thing needed to recreate an HPR site is in the feed

Challenge accepted

A lot of my toy projects have been around RSS and podcasts
I am working on a Episode describing a project I did looking for podcasts that have podfaded.
I starting thinking about what data is in the feed and thinking through a process for using the RSS data to recreate the HPR site

Project

Link to Project https://gitlab.com/norrist/hprfeed2db

DATA pulled directly from feed

explicit
title
author_name
author_email
link
description
summary - I think this is the same as description
pubdate
enclosures
Episode ID - extracted from title - HPR2341
feedparser and peewee
full feed to SQLite specs

40 Seconds on My Machine
20M hpr.sqlite


Notably Missing from the RSS feeds

Episode Series
Episode Tags

Next steps

markdown from db info

Main page
Corespondent pages
Episode pages
comments from comments feed

Manually build other markdown for static pages
about, contributing, ...
Static site generator
I don't think the tags are in the feed data


git clone https://gitlab.com/norrist/hprfeed2db
cd hprfeed2db/
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install feedparser peewee
python data_models.py
python feed.py
sqlite3 hpr.sqlite "select count(*) from episode"
