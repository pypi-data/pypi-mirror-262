## hpr1879 :: Hacking a Belt to Make it Fit

 In this episode I talk while I'm performing a belt hack. I bought a belt at Goodwill that is in excellent condition but does not fit me. To make it fit I need to cut off 6.25 inches and then put it back together.
This is the belt as I got it. Notice the very small screws holding the buckle to the belt.

The screws are out, the belt removed from the buckle. You can see here the two holes that accommodate the screws as well as the rectangular notch.

I've cut off 6.25" from the belt, ready to make the holes and notch in the remaining part.

Here I've clamped the part of the belt that I cut off to the remaining part to use as a template for making the holes and the notch.

Holes and notch cut in the remaining part of the belt. Doesn't look as nice as the original but it should work.

All done. Belt is reassembled and I'm wearing it, fits just right!
