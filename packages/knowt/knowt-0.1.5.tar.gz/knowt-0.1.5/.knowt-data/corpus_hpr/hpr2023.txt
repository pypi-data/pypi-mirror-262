## hpr2023 :: Setting up my Raspberry Pi 3

 Setting up my Raspberry Pi 3
I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 in March 2016, soon after it was released. I want to use it as a server since it's the fastest Pi that I own, so I have tried to set it up in the best way for that role.
In this episode I describe what I did in case you want to do something similar.
