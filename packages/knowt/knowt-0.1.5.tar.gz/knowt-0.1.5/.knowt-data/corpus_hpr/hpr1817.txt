When I made the reference to "two red lips" regarding resistor colors I didn't quite explain what that meant. It was a way I learned, way back when, to remember which color was which number on a resistor. I hadn't thought about it in years. It used rhyming and references scheme to line the colors up with values. 


0- Black - It's a "no" color, a zero
1- Brown - 'brow-one'
2- Red - Two red lips
3- Orange - Orange tree
4- Yellow - Yell for help
5- Green - a five dollar bill is green
6- Blue - Blue and sick
7- Violet - Violet heaven
8- Gray - Great
9- White - White wine
