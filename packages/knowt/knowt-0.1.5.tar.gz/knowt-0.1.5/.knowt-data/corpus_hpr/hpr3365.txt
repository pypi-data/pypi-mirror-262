PlugY 
PlugY is a mod whose primary purpose is to increase the stash size for Diablo II characters. Over the years it has grown to include numerous other useful functions, such as enabling Ladder Only Rune Words outside of the Battle.net Ladder, enabling the Uber quests outside of Battle.net and various other small tweaks and additions. PlugY is not a conversion of the original Diablo, and it doesn't alter gameplay by changing monster stats, skills, maps or items.
