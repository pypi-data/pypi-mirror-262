## hpr1392 :: Beginner's guide to the night sky

 
This is a personal view of the Universe, as viewed
from the Earth in the early 21st Century, by a somewhat
geeky chap. In this episode, I talk a little about my first memories
of looking at the night sky and how the modern science of astronomy
has its roots in ancient mythology, and how the sky provided
a picture book for humanity before we even did our first cave painting.
