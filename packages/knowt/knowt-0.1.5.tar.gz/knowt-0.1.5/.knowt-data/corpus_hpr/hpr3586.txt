Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2022-April/thread.html
Events Calendar
With the kind permission of LWN.net we are linking to
The LWN.net Community Calendar.
Quoting the site:
This is the LWN.net community event calendar, where we track
events of interest to people using and developing Linux and free software.

Reminders about show submission
Show spacing
Please remember that we normally ask that shows submitted by a host be spaced out by at least two weeks - unless the queue is extremely short of shows of course!
Commas between tags
A number of shows in recent weeks have been arriving with tags lists missing the requested commas. Hosts are requested to use these to separate tags, otherwise it can be difficult to work out where one tag ends and the next begins. How to interpret the following list, for example:
dog fish custard
Does it mean: 'dog fish, custard', 'dog, fish custard' or 'dog,fish,custard'?
Host names/handles or series names as tags
Next, a recommendation about the host name/handle or the series name as a tag. Tags are intended to help with finding shows.
We have another way of finding shows by host; the host name or handle is a link at the top of the show page which can be clicked to go to a list of all of the shows ever submitted by that host.
Also, if a show is part of a series, clicking on the series title on the show page will take you to all the shows in that series.
So, two tags best avoided are: the host name and the series name.
Use of Explicit only covers audio
Be aware that the selection made during the submission of a new show between 'Explicit' and 'Clean' only relates to the audio. Due to the world-wide distribution of shows we need to be sensitive to potential offense caused by swearwords and the like in the notes themselves. We would appreciate all HPR hosts being aware of these issues.
Please do not add your own intro and outro
A final reminder: it was decided via discussion on the HPR mailing list that we would automate the addition of the intro and outro to show audio. We would appreciate it if hosts did not add these themselves because work is then required to remove them before preparing the show for release.
Developments on HPR
Some work has been going on behind the scenes to improve the workflow which handles incoming shows and adds them to the database.
We have added a set of state values which indicate the processing flow so that people and software can track progress.
The calendar page has been adjusted to show some of these state mnemonics in addition to the Locked and Processing indicators we have had before.
The status mnemonics likely to be seen are:

SHOW_SUBMITTED - upload complete
METADATA_PROCESSED - shownotes processed to html
SHOW_POSTED - show in the database
MEDIA_TRANSCODED - audio all generated
UPLOADED_TO_IA - on the IA and visible
UPLOADED_TO_RSYNC_NET - archived on rsync.net

The steps required to move from one state to another have been streamlined as much as possible but they still require the intervention of the Janitors, so there is no guarantee about the time between arrival and the availability of shows on the HPR server or archive.org.
Access to HPR from Argentina
The problems reported in the last Community News have now been resolved.
Older HPR shows on archive.org, phase 2
Now that all shows from number 1 to the latest have been uploaded to the Internet Archive there are other tasks to perform.
During the uploading of shows in the range 1-870 we uploaded all the audio versions: wav, ogg, mp3, etc. We also uploaded any other files such as pictures or documentation. We do this for new shows as well.
The reason for this is to make self-contained shows on the Internet Archive, where previously such shows referred to the HPR server for various components.
The shows that had been uploaded during 2017 in the range 871 to 2429 did not include all these files. At that point we only had the mp3 versions of the audio, and these were what were uploaded, along with the notes.
During phase 1 of the upload process a method of turning the mp3 audio into all of the other formats was included, and this method is now being used to re-process shows 871 to 2429.
Statistics
We will keep a record of progress here as we re-upload shows numbered between 871 and 2429:

Re-uploads done so far: 131
Shows remaining to be done: 1428
