## hpr1527 :: Surviving A Roadtrip: GPS

 
I have spent many, many hours in a vehicle driving around. While travelling,
I've found a GPS to be one indispensable tool. These are some of the
GPS-related tips that I have discovered:


Having a "navigator" - someone else to help operate the GPS - can be very
        helpful in stressful driving situations. If you have someone that can help,
        let them handle GPS programming.

Know how to operate your GPS. Planning routes are just the beginning; know how
        to get your GPS to find food and lodging nearby, and how to change a route to
        avoid trouble (road closures, traffic jams, detours).

Update your maps! Old map data can drive you into construction zones or route
        you into congested areas that new map data would have let you avoid.

Be aware of tolls! The Northeast loves road tolls, and they can quickly add
        up. My GPS has the option to route around toll roads; so you can use that, or
        make sure you are prepared for that expense.

You can also use your GPS as a normal map, except it's a map automatically
        centered on your exact position. In certain situations, this can be more
        useful than having your GPS provide you with directions.

My GPS tells me the local speed limit, in addition to how fast I'm going. This
        is an excellent way to avoid getting a ticket.

Mount your GPS somewhere. Looking down into your lap is a good way to find
        yourself in a gutter.

GPS are not 100% accurate! Don't believe their lies! If the directions they
        are giving you sound bogus, use your better judgement.

BONUS: Cameras! If you want to take pictures while on the road, try leaving
        your camera set to the "Landscape" macro if you have that option. It will
        prevent focus issues when taking quick shots. Also, keep your camera
        easily accessible to avoid extra distraction. If you have a navigator, they
        might be the best photographers.
