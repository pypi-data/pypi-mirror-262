## hpr0049 :: XPlane

 Operat0r, is on approach at KLAX, runway 07R.  Will he make it? - maybe not.  He can crash and live to tell the tale with his X-Plane flight simulator.  X-Plane is a proprietary, multi-platform, flight simulation program.  While, he's no flight instructor, Operat0r's got a 'system' for landing X-Planes.
