## hpr2215 :: Kickstarter Omega2 Plus first time setup walkthrough

 I paid for one Omega2 Plus Kickstarter pledge. Later, as most do, the project offers upgrades. My pack was for one Omega2 plus, an OLED module, and the expansion board. After pledging I then added on another Omega2, a GPS module and a mini expansion board. Review wise, this is a good inexpensive IOT kit for any beginner. Someone that is more advanced can get into Arduino, or ESP8266 with microPython.
