## hpr3329 :: Linux Inlaws S01E29: The (one and only) Linux Kernel Contributor Panel

 In this episode, our two ageing heroes host an eclectic panel of kernel
contributors of a small, mostly unknown operating system called "Linux".
The panelists hail from all over the planet (sadly, no money or love would
buy Richard's or Linus' way onto that panel :-) but the discussion proves
more than interesting regardless of these uber-nerds being absent. All
will be revealed including the true age of Linux, one of Chris' secret
obsessions (hint: it's not software bugs), Linus Torvald's thought process
and evolution as such. Never mind Linux's second future high-level
programming language... Plus: a philosophical discussion of the social
impact of insulting from a pan-cultural perspective. Don't miss out on
this!
