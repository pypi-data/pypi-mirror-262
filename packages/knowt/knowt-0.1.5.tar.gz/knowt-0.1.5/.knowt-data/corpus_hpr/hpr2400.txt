How am I recording
I'm recording this episode, in my car, on a Samsung Galaxy A5 with a Neewer lavalier microphone (as recommended by HPR's own Jon Kulp) attached to my jacket, recording using the Auphonic Edit Android app (also on iOS).
Post-recording, I also ran the audio recorded using AuphonicEdit to the Auphonic website for levelling.
My portable podcasting setup
(previously mentioned on hpr2117) and used to record Sat On My Doorstep 1 - Alex, published to Anchor on 2017-09-13)

Google Pixel C
USB C to USB A OTG adapter (link to example, not the actual one I have)
Samson Q2U USB/XLR microphone* (equivalent to the AudioTechnica ATR2100USB)

As an aside*
Both Caroline and I use that particular microphone each to record The Bugcast each week. Both the Samson and AudioTechnica microphones have been recommended by Daniel J Lewis of The Audacity To Podcast for those podcasters who cannot afford professional level equipment.
