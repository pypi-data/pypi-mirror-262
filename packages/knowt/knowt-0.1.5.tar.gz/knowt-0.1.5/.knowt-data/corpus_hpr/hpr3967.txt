## hpr3967 :: Unsolicited thoughts on running open source software projects

 Some thoughts on the different ways you can run an open source
software project, comparing projects like password-store, which are
based on a mailing list and use a minimal forge platform, and others
that are based on a fancy forge like Github.
I think the fancy forge gives the open source software project a vibe
that we're more used to, in our capitalist society. It's a more
centralized structure that feels more like a service that's being
offered to the public, mostly in one direction. Meanwhile software
projects that don't have a platform for creating road maps, issues, pull
requests etc actually foster a stronger and more open community
structure, rather counter-intuitively, because the software is free and
everyone is able to contribute and modify the software for their own
use, and they in fact do. The idea of a canonical version of the
software is only a convenience, not a defining feature of it.
Let me know your thoughts on this.
