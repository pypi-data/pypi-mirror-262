## hpr3380 :: Building a Better Goodreads with ActivityPub

 Federated social media can open up some wonderful possibilities to reimagine some of the social apps we already use and find ways to do them better. In this episode I want to highlight a talk that aimed at such a reimagining involving an app I already use, Goodreads. My main use of it is to manage my book library, but it also involves a social aspect where you can be friends with people and share book reviews, recommendations, and so on. So seeing how this can be done differently with ActivityPub was very interesting to me.
