## hpr1290 :: MultiSystem: The Bootable Thumb Drive Creator

 
MultiSystem is a tool for creating bootable USB thumb drives that give
you the option launching multiple ISO images and other built in
diagnostic utilities. It can be an invaluable tool for system repair
techs.  Not to mention the many recovery and repair Live CDs that are
available to fix Linux, most bootable Windows repair and anti-virus
utilities run from a Linux based ISO.  The tech can even create ISO
images of Windows installation media and replace a stack of DVDs with
one thumb drive.  Besides the installable package, there is also a
MultiSystem LiveCD https://sourceforge.net/projects/multisystem/ that, if
I understand correctly, contains some recomended ISOs to install on your
thumb drive.
