## hpr1978 :: Ultra High Vacuum: loading samples

 
I hope this is the correct version of my introduction to Ultra high vacuum systems and loading samples. 


Please consult with a professional before using nitrogen and ultra high vacuum system.


Nitrogen is dangerous in close environments as it displaces oxygen so please consult the health and safety risks.
