## hpr1974 :: Ubuntu Community donations, Governance and Hardware

 
I went to https://Ubuntu.com - https://Xubuntu.org, https://getfedora.org/ and https://www.opensuse.org/ to see how donations with the linux vendors worked.


The only one that I found was non profit was debain.  It a real nonprofit certification in the USA.
