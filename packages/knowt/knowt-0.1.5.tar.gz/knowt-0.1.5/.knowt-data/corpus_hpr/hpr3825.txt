## hpr3825 :: Creating a natural aquarium

 An alternative method to the big box store way of setting up an
aquarium.

time, but is a healthier environment for your aquatic creatures and will
be a great conversation piece.
Learn how to emulate nature so that everything works together in its
own ecosystem from the bottom up. Only a little bit of patience is
needed.
