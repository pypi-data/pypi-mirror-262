Can a short url be thought of as time based

I maintain that in it's current likely implementations that it is not.  Especially since it is likely that the storage uses a 1 original URL to many shortened URLs.  However, I would think it would be possible to implement as a hashed function given the rights seeds.



KuraKura: questions about using mumble.

General conversation

Discussion about Orca and handling integration with various software packages.  Ken wants to motivate the HPR community to explore the issues that exist, and talk with developers from application projects about improving their orca integration.

JonDoe mentions that there might be dependencies and / or regressions that occur as changes are made due to hacks / workarounds that currently exist (both in orca and applications)

SndChaser plays https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne



Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
and never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
and auld lang syne*?
CHORUS

For auld lang syne, my jo,
for auld lang syne,
we’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet,
for auld lang syne.
And surely ye’ll be your pint-stowp!
and surely I’ll be mine!
And we’ll tak a cup o’ kindness yet,
for auld lang syne.
CHORUS
We twa hae run about the braes,
and pu’d the gowans fine;
But we’ve wander’d mony a weary fit,
sin auld lang syne.
CHORUS
We twa hae paidl’d i' the burn,
frae morning sun till dine;
But seas between us braid hae roar’d
sin auld lang syne.
CHORUS
And there’s a hand, my trusty fiere!
and gie's a hand o’ thine!
And we’ll tak a right gude-willy waught,
for auld lang syne.
CHORUS
