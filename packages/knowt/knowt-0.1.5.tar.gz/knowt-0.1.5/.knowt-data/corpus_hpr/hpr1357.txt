## hpr1357 :: Whats in my bag, and other stories

 In the show I discuss my philosophy of travelling light, how to travel without baggage or computers, how to setup disposable accounts and protect your accounts from compromise. Also I talk about how I am adjusting to living without a car in Kansas, and other topics.
