## hpr2445 :: Information Underground: Backwards Capitalism

 
The Info-Underground guys consider why capitalism does (or maybe doesn't) work, why people use it as a tool for a better life (or maybe don't), and what the source of ambition, commercial aspiration, and greed truly is (or maybe isn't).
