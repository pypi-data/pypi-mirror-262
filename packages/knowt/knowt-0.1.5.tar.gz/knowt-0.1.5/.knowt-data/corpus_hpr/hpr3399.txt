## hpr3399 :: Linux Inlaws S01E36: Open Source Licenses

 
    In this episode Chris is trying hard to get Martin to sleep by elaborating on the
    subject of free and open source software licenses but fails miserably. Listen to a
    more than riveting episode on the ins and outs of licensing FLOSS code bases in addition
    to banter about Brexit, plans for a reshaping of Europe after the invasion of England
    and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland leave the UK.
