## hpr1094 :: Linux, Beer, and Who Cares?

 By BuyerBrown, RedDwarf, and FiftyOneFifty
This is a recording of an impromptu
bull session that came about one night after BuyerBrown, RedDwarf,
and I had been waiting around on Mumble for another host to join in. 
After giving up on recording our scheduled podcast, we stayed up for
about an hour talking and drinking when Buyer suddenly asked Red and
I to find current events articles concerning Linux.   When that task
was completed, Buyer announced he was launching a live audiocast over
Mixlr.com with us as his guests.  You are about to hear the result. 
Topics range from the prospects of Linux taking over the small
business server market, now that Microsoft has retreated from the
field,  Android tablets and the future of the desktop in general, and
the (at the time) revelation that Steam would be coming to Linux (on
the last point, let me be the first to say that I am glad some of the
concerns in my rant appear to be unfounded, apparently after a lot of
work, Left for Dead 2 runs faster under Linux than it does under
Windows with equivalent hardware.  This podcast was recorded on a
whim but I can't promise it won't happen again.
