## hpr3969 :: Game Sales

 There are some games I will buy for the full prices as soon as they
are released, such as any of the Civilization games. But I also like to
find bargains, and I recently scored a fantastic deal on Steam that
motivated me to share this information with the community since I know
there are other people out there who enjoy computer games.
