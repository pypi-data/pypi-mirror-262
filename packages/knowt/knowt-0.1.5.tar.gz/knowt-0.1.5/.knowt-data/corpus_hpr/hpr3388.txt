 In this episode our aging heroes host the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). Its president, Matthias
Kirschner talk about the past, the present and the future of free and open source software not only
from an FSFE perspective. Never mind how he got into computers in the first place. Also, different opinions
about communism in general and its implementations (and the flaws of the first rounds of implementations)
are touched upon. So historians, FLOSS users and enthusiasts, communists and free spirits: This is your episode!
