## hpr1518 :: 02 The podcasts I listen to

 I listen to a lot of podcasts. I started listening to them back in around 2005 after buying my first portable player.
This is a continuation of the 85 podcast feeds I subscribe to. In my last show I reported on the first 41 of the set. Here are the remaining 44 feeds.
Note: The list below is generated by a script which performs a query on my database. I have relied on parsing the feeds themselves for the websites, using the link value. In a few cases the value is unfortunately incorrect or missing because the feed is mis-configured.
I have included an OPML version of the list in case you want to load it or part of it into your podcatcher. Find it at https://www.hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1516.opml

Rationally Speaking

Format: RSS 2.0
Last episode: 2014-04-06
Description: Rationally Speaking is the bi-weekly podcast of New York City Skeptics. Join hosts Massimo Pigliucci and Julia Galef as they explore the borderlands between reason and nonsense, likely from unlikely, and science from pseudoscience. Any topic is fair game as long as we can bring reason to bear upon it, with both a skeptical eye and a good dose of humor! We agree with the Marquis de Condorcet, who said that in an open society we ought to devote ourselves to "the tracking down of prejudices in the hiding places where priests, the schools, the government, and all long-established institutions had gathered and protected them." Rationally Speaking is produced by Benny Pollak and is recorded in the heart of New York City's Greenwich Village.
