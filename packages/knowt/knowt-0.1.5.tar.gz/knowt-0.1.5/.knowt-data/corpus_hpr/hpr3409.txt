## hpr3409 :: Linux Inlaws S01E37: All about Hacker Public Radio

 
    In this episode of our beloved open source podcast rapidly approaching its
    zenith of popularity (with hopefully not an equally rapid decline afterwards)
    our two elderly heroes pay tribute to Hacker Public Radio in general and
    Ken Fallon in particular. Plus: a never-heard-of-before peek into Martin's
    very own private life (we lift the veil and reveal it all - don't miss this!)
