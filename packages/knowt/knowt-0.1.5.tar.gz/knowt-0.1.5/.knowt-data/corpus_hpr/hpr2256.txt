## hpr2256 :: Modular Game Scaling

 NOTE: the audio didn't cut together as smoothly as I remember from the first time, probably because I forgot to record at 44.1 KHz
In this episode I explain in broad terms how I programmed a game system to adjust its display resolution using three distinct modules operating individually and in concert.

The "metagame" (launcher) module accepts an argument describing the size of the window available for display
The "gameplay" module is informed of the space available as a 'window' into the game world and uses it for one thing or another
The "graphics" module opens a window at the specified size and modifies the graphical assets if needed

Once again I recorded in parts using a program called Urecord on my pocket computer (mobile phone).
I program using Pygame, post on a GNU Social account, maintain a personal website at NoxBanners.NET, and study programming techniques at Refactoring.com, style at Python.org, and sometimes patterns at Portland Pattern Repository
