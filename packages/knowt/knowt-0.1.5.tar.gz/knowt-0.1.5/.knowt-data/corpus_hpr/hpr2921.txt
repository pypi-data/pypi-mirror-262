## hpr2921 :: Geocaching with the family

 In this episode, Dave and his family wander the paths of Sandall Beat Wood in Doncaster to participate in the game of Geocaching. During this time, which demonstrates an unusual level of failure in us playing the game, we try and explain what the game is all about.
No, not The Game...
As I explain at the beginning of the episode, this is a fairly long episode which hasn't been edited down much, so there are a lot of ambient pauses and heavy breathing to be enjoyed.
Recorded in the field on my Olympus DM-3 voice recorder.
