## hpr3102 :: RFC 5005 Part 2 – Webcomics, subscribers and feed readers

 An interview with two passionate RFC 5005 fans on how to handle big Atom feeds
This conversation took almost an hour, so I split it into two shows:

Part 1 talks mostly about the RFC itself, what it means and why. HPR 3082
Part 2 goes into personal experiences with the RFC and with syndication in general, in particular in the context of web comics.

This is part 2.
In this show I’m talking to:

Publ is like a static site generator, but dynamic. It produces RFC 5005 archive feeds, of course:

Thoughts on ephemeral content vs content worth archiving and how they relate to protocols:

Conversation notes

Back in 2002, Aaron Swartz published his joke MIME-header-based RSS 3:

The cultural context at the time and the rivalry between RSS 0.91+, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 and Atom deserves a show of its own.
