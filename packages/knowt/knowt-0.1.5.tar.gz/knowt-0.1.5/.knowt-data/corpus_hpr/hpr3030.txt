Additional thoughts after recording this episode

Closing one eye seems to solve the problem though not very practical. It doesn’t seem to matter which eye I close.
Doesn’t seem to bother me with the other 8” Samsung tablet or any other tablet / phone.
Counter intuitively increasing the brightness makes things better
Searching for eye strain and Samsung brought up one or two results of people saying a similar thing to myself; one person commenting that they were fed up of people telling them to get an eye test and like myself they do not have this problem with any other device.
