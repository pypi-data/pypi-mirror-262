 The power of GNU Readline - part 2
In part 1 we looked at some Control key and Meta key sequences as well as the Backspace and DEL keys in the context of GNU Readline.
The full-length notes (available here) contain a brief summary of what we covered and introduce cutting and pasting the GNU Readline way, with some examples.
