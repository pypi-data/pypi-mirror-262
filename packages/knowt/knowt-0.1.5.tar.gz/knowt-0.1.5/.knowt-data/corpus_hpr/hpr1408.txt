## hpr1408 :: Drupal in Gothenburg with Addison Berry and others

 In a sunny Gothenburg, the spring of 2012, we find a lot of happy web developers attending DrupalCamp. This is the second show with conversations from that event. This time you will hear Addison Berry from Lullabot, Henrik from All In IT Radio as well as Patrik and Cornelius.
If you want to hear what Henrik and I thought about this years DrupalCamp, then you should have a listen to the episode "Con of the Year" over on our podcast. There we talk about all the conferences we have attended in 2013, including DrupalCamp, FSCONS and Retrospelsmässan.
