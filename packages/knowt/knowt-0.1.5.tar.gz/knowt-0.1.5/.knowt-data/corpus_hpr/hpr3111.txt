Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:

Error feedback from show notes
Most of the shows we process require us to make some level of modifications to get them posted. This ranges from fixing tags to a complete rewrite of the shownotes, or verifying whether intros were actually added or not.
Each modification that we make means that it requires more human intervention and prevents us from being able to completely automate the upload process. In addition there is a non trivial amount of time needed to "fix" these issues. This can range from a few minutes to an hour or more per show, and with 260 shows a year this mounts up.
We normally don't contact hosts about these issues as it is usually quicker to fix the issues than composing emails, and waiting for the reply that may never come. For the most part our experience has been that hosts are more than willing to fix these issues if they are aware of them.
As part of the ongoing steps toward automation, would hosts be open to the idea of getting a processing report once we have posted the show? This would list all the issues the test tools found and the steps that we needed to take to rectify them.
Making changes to shows after upload
Sometimes an error or omission in notes for an HPR episode isn't noticed until the show is posted to the site. In recent times a few hosts have sent in their changes by way of comments. This is not ideal:

There's a limit on how much text a comment can hold
The comment form has a nasty habit of stripping backslashes, so code corrections can be messed up
We don't put comments on the show's page on archive.org, so such corrections will not be seen by people reading the notes there

The HPR admins would prefer changes to be sent in the form of emails to admin at hackerpublicradio.org. They will then be applied to the show notes and the archive.org version updated in step.
Tags and Summaries
Thanks to the following contributor for sending in updates in the past month:
Windigo
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 10 shows which were without them.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
