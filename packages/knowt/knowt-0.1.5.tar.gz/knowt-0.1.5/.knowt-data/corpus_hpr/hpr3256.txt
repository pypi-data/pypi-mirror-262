## hpr3256 :: Update, MS Teams, Covid 19, Raspberry PI 400 Raspberry PI 4 8GB Centos

 Hey guys I have been doing a lot of MS Teams it works on Linux not so I can have 365 on my ubuntu browser and MS teams installed. (Work complete from a linux box) (It's great) The Raspberry PI400 is a great box you should get it. Also I thought the Raspberry 4 8GB to be very solid.
