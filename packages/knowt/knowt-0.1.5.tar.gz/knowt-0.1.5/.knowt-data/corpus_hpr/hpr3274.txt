Story of ricing my own desktop:

Always been into customising look/feel, never satisfied
Found Luke Smith and liked i3, made own version.
Pandemic hits! Started learning Python, JavaScript but had no real use for them...
Made a website (inspired by disconnecting from social media)
check out richcolq.xyz and github.com/clearnitesky

What programs am I using?

dwm (obviously)
dmenu
st
surf / brave
sxhkd - various short cuts sorted by purpose
dunst
sxiv/feh
zathura
my status stuff using dwmstat script
a look in ~/.local/bin
I recently learned about awk and rewrote all icon scripts which is what inspired me to record this episode.

What next?

Is it necessary to patch dwm? Probably not.
I've come to believe that the real value in these experiments has come from my custom status scripts and keyboard shortcuts - not from patching new features into dwm. It does what I need it to (manage windows!)

Thanks for watching!
