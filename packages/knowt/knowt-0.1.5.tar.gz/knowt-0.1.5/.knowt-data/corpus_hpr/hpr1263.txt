## hpr1263 :: 3G Tunnels (Sshuttle)

 
Timttmy and NYbill have a chat about 3G connectivity and Sshuttle. Sshuttle is
app that blends VPN and SSH proxy like features. They also touch on AUR packaging and 
the recent Linode hacks. Then start to reminisce about OGGcamps past and the good'ol days of
the Linux Outlaw forums. And what do most geeks do when they hang out? They finish up 
talking about their computer gear.
