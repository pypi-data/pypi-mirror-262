## hpr1723 :: Success With Students

 
For his second attempt at a solo episode of HPR, Kevie talks about a very positive experience he had introducing school pupils to podcasting.  From this he was able to discuss the benefits of Creative Commons music and using open source, cross platform software.  The ultimate success came when three students took the plunge and installed Linux on their own computers.
