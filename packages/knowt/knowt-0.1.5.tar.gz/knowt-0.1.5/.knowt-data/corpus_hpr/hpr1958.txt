Enlightenment


The original reason Enlightenment exists - The Window Manager. From here everything else spawned. This is really the flagship product, closely followed by EFL itself. The window manager is a lean, fast, modular and very extensible window manager for X11 and Linux. It is classed as a “desktop shell” providing the things you need to operate your desktop (or laptop), but is not a whole application suite. This covers launching applications, managing their windows and doing other system tasks like suspending, reboots, managing files etc.

We are moving towards Wayland as the base display system where Enlightenment is being worked on to become a full Wayland compositor on its own. This of course takes time and has its rough edges along the way, but we are not standing still, and one day will leave X11 behind.

Of course Enlightenment is built on top of EFL, using the libraries we wrote for it to do its UI as well as to run the entire compositor itself. This means that any improvements to EFL turn up in the compositor as well.

Enlightenment also is the Window Manager and Compositor for Tizen due in part to its efficiency and feature-set.

LibreOffice


LibreOffice is the most widely used free open source office software. It is a community-driven project of The Document Foundation. LibreOffice is developed by professionals and by users, just like you, who believe in the principles of free software and in sharing their work with the world in a non-restrictive way. At the core of these principles is the promise of better-quality, highly-reliable and secure software that gives you greater flexibility at zero cost and no end-user lock-in. LibreOffice works natively with the Open Document Format, but also brings you support for by far the most file types for office-documents. It comes with support for over 80 languages and with a whole amount of other unique features to work with your texts, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings and data.
