## hpr1753 :: Introducing a 5 year old to Sugar on Toast

 
This was me introducing my 5 year old to her new laptop with Sugar on Toast. 


A family member had no use for an old 7 year old netbook so I installed the trisquel version of Sugar, the one laptop per child operating system.


This is a response to this episode: https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1726 I find it ticks all the boxes. 


Recorded with a phone and spoken mainly in a different language. I did conversion to FLAC from a mono mp3 probably the same if I just uploaded the MP3 directly. No editing was done.
