## hpr3062 :: Vassal: How to play board games while remote

 A friend, a stranger and I played https://www.vassalengine.org/ together.
We played the Carcasonne-simple 1.2 module downloaded from https://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Carcassonne.
There are some things that may be confusing the first time, but the game engine works well, the rule- and tile-set we played worked well, text chat is surprisingly adequate for talking to people while playing, and I would like to play again some time.
