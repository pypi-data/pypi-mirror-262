## hpr1270 :: Fathers Day Special: Jon Kulp interviews his Dad

 While my parents are visiting from Tennessee I take advantage of the opportunity to talk to my dad for awhile about his early days
of computing. He has a PhD in statistics and has been using computers since the 1960s. We talk about his programming in
Fortran and Cobol, about building Heathkit projects, about his duties as a VP
for Information Technology at a small private university in Nashville, and about his more recent programming in Windows.
