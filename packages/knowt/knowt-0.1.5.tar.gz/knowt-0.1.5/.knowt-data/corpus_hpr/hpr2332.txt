## hpr2332 :: Installing DD-WRT on ASUS RT-N66U

 Notes

This worked for me, but it’s no guarantee it’ll work for you
It’s been a couple weeks and I’m doing this from memory with the help of the resources I used, so I may have missed or misremembered a step
Read the relevant documentation for yourself

DO NOT use the router database to determine the firmware version to use

Resetting and Clearing

Recovery Mode (use Reset Button):

With router unplugged, press reset button
Plug in power
Hold reset button for ~10 seconds until the power LED is blinking slowly

Clear the NVRAM (use WPS Button):

With router unplugged, press WPS button
Plug in power
Hold WPS button for ~10 seconds
Note: NVRAM is where the settings for the router are stored

30-30-30 Reset

Push reset button with the router powered on for 30 seconds
Pull the power cord for 30 seconds while holding the reset button
Plug the power cord in for 30 seconds, while holding the reset button


Upload via Web GUI

Tried using the Web GUI method, but ASUS firmware checks to see if it’s an official version (i.e. signed by ASUS), and will only install it if it is
DD-WRT isn’t an official version, obviously, but not all is lost, uploading via recovery utility works

Upload via Recovery Utility

Download router firmware: dd-wrt.v24-26138_NEWD-2_K3.x-big-RT-N6UU.trx

big version includes more tools than mega version

Make the following network config information on the computer you’ll upload the firmware from:

IP = 192.168.1.12
Subnet = 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway = 192.168.1.1

Perform 30-30-30 Reset
Perform Clear NVRAM
Perform Recovery Mode
Navigate to 192.168.1.1 and follow screen directions to upload DD-WRT firmware
It may take up to 10 minutes to reboot (don’t think it took that long, but I waited that long)
Perform Recovery Mode
Navigate to 192.168.1.1 and select Reset NVRAM
Navigate to https://192.168.1.1/do.htm?cmd=nvram+commit, and then select reboot and wait ~10 minutes
Perform 30-30-30 Reset
Navigating to 192.168.1.1 should now bring you to your new DD-WRT installation

Remember to secure it

Note: installing mini version (referenced in online directions) isn’t necessary prior to installing the big/mega version
