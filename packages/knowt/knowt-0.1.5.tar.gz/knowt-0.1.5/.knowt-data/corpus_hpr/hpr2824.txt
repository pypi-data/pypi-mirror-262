## hpr2824 :: Gnu Awk - Part 15

 Introduction
This is the fifteenth episode of the “Learning Awk” series which is being produced by b-yeezi and myself.
This is the second of a pair of episodes looking at redirection in Awk scripts.
In this episode I will spend some time looking at the getline command used for explicit input (as opposed to the usual implicit sort), often with redirection. The getline command is a complex subject which I will cover only relatively briefly. You are directed to the getline section of the GNU Awk User’s Guide for the full details.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
