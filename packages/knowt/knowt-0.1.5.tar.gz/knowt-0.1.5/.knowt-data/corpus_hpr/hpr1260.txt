## hpr1260 :: Interview with GMC about OHM 2013

 
OHM2013 is a five day outdoor international camping festival for hackers and makers, and those with an inquisitive mind. On 31st July 2013, 3000 of those minds will descend upon on an unassuming patch of land, at the Geestmerambacht festival grounds, 30km north of Amsterdam. We are interrupted by Nick Farr, who will tell us a bit about Hackers on a Plane, who organise a trip from North America to Europe to participate in this event.
