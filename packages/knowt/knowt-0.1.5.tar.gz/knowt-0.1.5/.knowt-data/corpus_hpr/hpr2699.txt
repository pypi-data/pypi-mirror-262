 Bash Tips - 15 (More auxiliary Bash tips)
Pitfalls for the unwary Bash loop user
This is the fifteenth episode covering useful tips for Bash users. In the last episode we looked at the 'for' loop, and prior to that we looked at 'while' and 'until' loops. In this one I want to look at some of the loop-related issues that can trip up the unwary user.
Loops in Bash are extremely useful, and they are not at all difficult to use in their basic forms. However, there are some perhaps less than obvious issues that can result in unexpected behaviour.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
