## hpr1268 :: What's in my bag

 
A short episode by me: "David Whitman" about things I carry in my backpack which is my go to work bag. Normally there would be food in there but it is Sunday morning and thankfully I have left no food in the bag. Food ideally goes to work and is consumed but there have been those times.........the forgotten orange etc.
