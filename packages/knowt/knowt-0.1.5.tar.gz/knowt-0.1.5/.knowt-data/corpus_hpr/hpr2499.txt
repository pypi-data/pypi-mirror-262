## hpr2499 :: Tuning around the HF 40Mtr band

 Tuning around the band
In this episode I tune around a small portion of the HF (High Frequency) band in the 40 Meters section which in the UK covers 7 to 7.2Mhz.
Equipment details
The mode being used was mostly LSB (Lower Side Band)

At the end of the recording I briefly switch mode to to listen to a commercial station on AM (Amplitude modulation).

The radio being used is my trusty and much loved Kenwood TS 940S

The antenna used is a dipole tuned for the 40 Meter band.

I used my trusty Dictaphone and internal microphone to do the recording

If you want to hold private conversations with another party over radio then perhaps amateur radio is not for you as this goes against the whole principle of Amateur Radio.
Listening to amateur radio broadcasts is actively encouraged, and in the UK a licence is not required for listening.
A simple receiver capable of listening to sideband broadcasts and odd bit of long wire is all that's required.
In the past it was common to hear an Amateur operator saying goodbye to any short wave listeners at the end of their conversation. If you listen carefully at about 10 minutes in the station DF2BO says goodbye to anybody still listening.
Stations received

DF2BO speaking to Peter VK4ZP in Brisbane Queensland, on 7.16209 MHz
CW station calling CQ on 7.00994 MHz, I don't know the callsign or details of the station as I can't read Morse code however I did recognise the distinctive rhythm of the letters C and Q.
Transmitting the letters CQ on a particular radio frequency is used as an invitation for any operators listening on that frequency to respond. It is widely used in amateur radio.
German station unidentified on 7.15794 MHz
DF2BO name, Tom, near Stuttgart speaking to Rob VK2XZ who I can't hear on 7.16200 MHz, then speaking briefly with Chris VK2SR who I can't hear
Another brief bit of morse code
An unknown commercial station broadcasting on 7.35520 on AM
