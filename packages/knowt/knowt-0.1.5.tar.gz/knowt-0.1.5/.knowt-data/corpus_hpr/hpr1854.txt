## hpr1854 :: Installing Ubuntu on the Asus TP500L

 
Getting to BIOS
		
In Windows, go to Settings 
Search for advanced startup options
Follow your nose to Boot to UEFI settings
Can also get there by doing Shift+click on the Restart or Shutdown buttons then clicking through to advanced options until you find "enter setup." Pressing F2 never worked for me

In the BIOS
		
Security tab: disable "Secure Boot Control"
Boot tab: disable "Fast Boot"
Boot tab: Here Asus support says to enable "launch CSM" (Compatibility Support Mode) but it wouldn't boot from the Ubuntu USB image this way. It worked when I left CSM disabled. I bet CSM works with a Windows or DOS USB.

Plug in USB with Ubuntu image on it
Restart computer and hold ESC key down, forcing windows boot menu to appear
Choose the USB drive to boot from, off you go!
