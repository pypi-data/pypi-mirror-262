## hpr2327 :: A Texan's view on Why only a Native Born person can be President

 Based on my limited knowledge of our founding documents. I have read them a few times and had a few basic classes about our founding documents. So I am not lawyer or Professor just a normal person with a very normal education. I did see the starting documents at the national archive last sept 2016 and they are real and can be publicly read.
