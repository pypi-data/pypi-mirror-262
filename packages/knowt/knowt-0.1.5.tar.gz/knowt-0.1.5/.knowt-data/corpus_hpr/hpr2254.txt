 Introduction to Model Rocketry
In this episode I introduce the hobby of model rocketry. I specifically highlight some of the advanced elements of the hobby to show how model rocketry goes from being a fun activity for kids to a serious hobby enjoyed by many adults.
Outline

Errata
In the show I said that G. Harry Stine worked at the White Sands Missile Base. The correct name for that facility is White Sands Missile Range. But, during the time that Stine worked there, it would have been called the White Sands Proving Ground. https://www.wsmr.army.mil/
