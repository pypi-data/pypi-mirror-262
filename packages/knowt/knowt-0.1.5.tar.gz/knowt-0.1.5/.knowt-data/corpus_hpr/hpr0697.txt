## hpr0697 :: Aaron Seigo on accessibility in KDE. An outtake from Frostcast Episode 36.

 After his outspoken criticism of accessibility in Ubuntu, Jonathan Nadeau has become the standard bearer for accessibility on the FLOSS desktop. In his interview with the KDE spokesperson Aaron Seigo, Jonathan didn't ask any questions about accessibility. I was expecting to hear what accessibility improvements are in the pipeline for KDE.

When I contacted Jonathan about it he immediately replied saying that they did talk about accessibility. He didn't add it as the show was running too long and that he might release it as a separate podcast. I floated the idea of releasing it on HPR and he was kind enough to mail me the segment.

HPR has now no shows in the queue. HPR is a community feed and without shows it will cease to exist. Many people have stepped up and recorded shows but I know there are many more out there who have it in them to contribute. With that in mind please record a show today. Thank you.
