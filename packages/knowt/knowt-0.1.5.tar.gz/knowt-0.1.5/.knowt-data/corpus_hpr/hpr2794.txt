## hpr2794 :: Interview with Martin Wimpress

 Ubuntu, MATE.
Two words which, taken separately, refer to great products.
On one side, Ubuntu, one of the most popular, if not the most popular, linux distribution.
On the other side, the MATE desktop environment, also very popular.
One person took those two elements and combined them together to make Ubuntu MATE. That person is Martin Wimpress, and he joined me on the 21st of March to talk about the past, present, and future of the project.
