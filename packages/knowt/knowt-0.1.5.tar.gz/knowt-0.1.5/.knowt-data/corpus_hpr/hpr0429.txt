 My Wife And Her New Machine



Music in this episode:



The incomparable 




Albert Collins




His very brief listing at the Podsafe Music Network can be found

here, but it doesn't do this great man justice.



By all means, check out his 

Wikipedia page for a nice overview.  His career 
was shorter than it should have been, but he had no equal.  



May he rest in peace.
