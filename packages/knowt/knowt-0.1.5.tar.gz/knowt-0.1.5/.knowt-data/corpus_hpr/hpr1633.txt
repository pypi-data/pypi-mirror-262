## hpr1633 :: The OggCamp organizers

 In this set of OggCamp interviews I talk to Dan Lynch and Fabian Scherschel from Linux Outlaws and Mark Johnson, who was the man on the ground this year, organizing OggCamp in Oxford Hotel this year. We talk about organizing OggCamp and podcasting and small, unknown Universities in little Towns like Oxford. ;)
