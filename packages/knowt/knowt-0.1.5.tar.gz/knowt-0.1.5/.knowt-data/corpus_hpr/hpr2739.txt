## hpr2739 :: Bash Tips - 19

 Arrays in Bash (Supplemental auxiliary Bash tips)
This is the fourth and last of a small group of shows on the subject of arrays in Bash. It is also the nineteenth show in the Bash Tips sub-series.
In the last show we continued with the subject of parameter expansion in the context of arrays. There are other aspects of this that could be looked at, but we’ll leave it for the moment and may revisit it in the future.
In this episode we will look in more depth at the declare (typeset) built in command and at some commands that are related (readonly and local), We will also look at the commands that assist with loading data into arrays: mapfile (readarray) and read.
Long notes
As usual I have provided detailed notes and examples for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
