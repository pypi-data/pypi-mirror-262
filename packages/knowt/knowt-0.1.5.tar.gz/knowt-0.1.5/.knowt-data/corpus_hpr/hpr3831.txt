Article: What
is "Port Forwarding"?

Author: Wikipedia. (N/A).
In computer networking, port forwarding or port mapping is an
application of network address translation (NAT) that redirects a
communication request from one address and port number combination to
another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a
router or firewall. This technique is most commonly used to make
services on a host residing on a protected or masqueraded (internal)
network available to hosts on the opposite side of the gateway (external
network), by remapping the destination IP address and port number of the
communication to an internal host.
