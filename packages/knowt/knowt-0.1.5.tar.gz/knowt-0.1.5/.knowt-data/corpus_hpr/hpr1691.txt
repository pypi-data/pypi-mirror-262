## hpr1691 :: Arduino 101 Arduino IO

 In this two-part series, Klaatu introduces you to the Arduino. First, learn about the breadboard and how to make electricity course through it in order to power your very own simple circuit.
To follow along with what Klaatu is talking about, refer to these two graphics:

https://openclipart.org/detail/181334/microcontroller--by-b.gaultier-181334

And here are diagrams of the simple circuits that Klaatu constructs.The simple code to reset the servo:
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo;

int servoPosition;

void setup()
{
  myservo.attach(13);
  myservo.write(90);
}

void loop() {}
And the code that responds to input:
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo; 

int servoPosition;
int servoMax = 180;
int servoMin = 0;

int value;
int valMax = 600;
int valMin = 50;


void setup()
{
  myservo.attach(13);
}

void loop() 
{
  value = analogRead(0);
  servoPosition = map(value, valMin, valMax, servoMax, servoMin);
  servoPosition = constrain(servoPosition, servoMin, servoMax);
  myservo.write(servoPosition);
}
And here is a bonus diagramme that you can try to create, using a light sensor, servo, and resistor.
