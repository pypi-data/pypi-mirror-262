## hpr1398 :: Batteries Part 1

 A show about batteries - Part 1
I can't take the credit for all this detailed information in my podcast, I found this fantastic website many years ago while investigating why the battery in my expensive razor prematurely failed. I tried to hunt for the site but couldn't find it. I wrote up all my notes from memory and recorded the show. It wasn't until I started working on part 2 of my batteries show that I stumbled across this long forgotten site - at least I think it's the same one as it talks about the memory effect on satellites and doctor's pagers so I guess it must be the same one. I'm indeed delighted to find it still exists, and I may very well read it again from top to bottom. It looks like it's been updated a little too. Well done ka7oei a fantastic resource right enough.

Two Possible Chargers (For use in the UK)
I found it very difficult to find a slow trickle charger, here are two possibilities, you may need to settle for a fast charger as the slow ones now seem to be like hen's teeth, (VERY HARD TO GET).
This is perhaps a little slow with a charge current of only 150ma, would take about 17Hrs to charge 2100 mAh batteries.

The charger I use is made by the same company as this although mine is a different model. My model charges at 200ma, and takes about 13 Hrs to charge a 2100 mAh battery. I can't tell what charge current this charger deliveries, but suspect it's a simple slow charger, probably old stock, as I said slow chargers are getting like hen's teeth.
