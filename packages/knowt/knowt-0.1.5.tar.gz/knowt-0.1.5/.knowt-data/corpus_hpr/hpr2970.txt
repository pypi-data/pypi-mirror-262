## hpr2970 :: The Fediverse

 The Fediverse is the name given to the collection of social media platforms that are distributed and interconnected. Distributed means that the servers are not centrally controlled, but are available to users in a variety of forms and conditions. And interconnected means they use protocols that are designed to allow communication between different platforms as well as different servers. The most common of these protocols is ActivityPub.
