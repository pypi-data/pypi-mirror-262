## hpr2084 :: Cleaning the Throttle Body on My Pickup Truck

 In this episode I take you along for the ride as I do a little bit of maintenance on my pickup truck. I've been trying to track down the source of of a rough idling problem that sometimes turns into stalling out. I already replaced the fuel filter (did not solve the rough idling problem but probably was due anyway), and here I make an audio recording as I clean the throttle body, which apparently is one of the first things you should do when your vehicle is idling roughly and stalling out. Still not sure if I have totally fixed it but it seems to run OK so at least I did not mess it up any worse.
