## hpr1726 :: 15 Excuses not to Record a show for HPR

 
Inspired by a recent meeting with Ken Fallon at Fossdem, Knightwise presents 15 excuses not to record for Hacker Public Radio.


I don't have the right Gear
It doesn't sound so polished
I don't know how to upload
I don't have a radio voice
I don't have the time
I'm shy
I don't have anything to say
The stuff I know about is realy niche and noone will be interested
What if I get negative comments
Who would listen to my show anyway
I've never done this before
I'll get around to it someday
I recorded a show but I'm too afraid to submit it
It takes me a long time to edit out the "um" and "er"
I don't know enough about audio editing yet
