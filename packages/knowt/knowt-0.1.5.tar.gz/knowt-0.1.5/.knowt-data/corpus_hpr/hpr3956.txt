discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

FOSDEM 2024

FOSDEM 2024 will take place on Saturday 3rd and Sunday 4th of
February 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. It will be at the usual location,
the ULB (Universit√© libre de Bruxelles).
Neither Ken nor Dave will be attending this time.
If anyone wishes to apply for a stand on HPR's behalf, and if
people want to help out doing the key speaker interviews, please get in
touch.

Site migration

During September effort has gone into fixing broken links in the
static site templates and the database itself.
There are still more links to correct however.
Each show page now contains a link to the version of the show
uploaded to the Internet Archive. If there are HPR links in older shows
that have not been updated yet, this copy can be used instead.
