## hpr1332 :: Jingles

 
During OHM2013, we met up with stich and the crew on rainbow island and they were gracious enough to let HPR have a booth in the shade there. He also found some time to send us in some soundbytes (words) to be used for jingles. He says "It's food for editors and are not production ready jingles (i don't have background sounds). If you need any other rendition, just drop me a line."


He releases them to us under a cc-by license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/).
