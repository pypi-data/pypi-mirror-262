This week we do a deep-geek-dive into setting up Amahi, a powerful server for the home with the ease of use of a smartphone. Web based interfaces, point-and-click addition of applications, tons of Geeky functionality : Its all there in Amahi. With a spot of music from Planet Boelex and a recording made 'on the road' its another "Knightcast".
