In this episode Knightwise talks about the cross-platform tools he uses for
his day job as a freelance IT consultant. All three of the major OS platforms
(Linux, OS X and Windows) have their strengths, so by leveraging systems from
across all ecosystems Knightwise can use what he feels is the best tool for
any individual task.


Use the tool that's right for you without letting the fanboys or the zealots get in your way.
