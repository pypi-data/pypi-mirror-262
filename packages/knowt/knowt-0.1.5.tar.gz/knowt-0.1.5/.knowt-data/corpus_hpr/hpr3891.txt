Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:

Relocation of the HPR site
A lot of work has gone into relocating HPR to a new server as well as
migrating to a static site. There is still work to do.

The main database has been moved from
anhonesthost.com
The static site generator written by Rho`n is being
used to generate the entire new website (with a few exceptions).
The remaining dynamic features (e.g. show submission and comment
entry) are provided by a PHP interface
There are outstanding issues with email on the server so at the
moment show submission needs manual intervention from the Janitors.
The hpr mailing list is not working at present
The way in which new shows are processed has had to be changed and
shows containing pictures are not yet being rendered properly
