## hpr2085 :: Penguicon 2016 Report

 
Penguicon 2015 is a combined technology and science fiction convention in Southfield, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, and presented over 500 hours of programming over the entire weekend. Of this, around 100 hours were open source, tech-related. In this episode I give you my personal diary of my experience at this great event.
