## hpr2214 :: Upgrading Vehicle Lights From Halogen to LED

 This episode is about the process of upgrading halogen vehicle lights to LED. I did this on my pickup truck for the interior dome light, the brake lights, the third brake light, front and back turn signal lights, the backup lights, and also for the license plate lights. While I'm talking about this process, I also install new LED brake light bulbs on our Honda CR-V. I almost forgot to talk about the necessity of installing resistors to handle the problem of hyperflashing with the blinker lights.
