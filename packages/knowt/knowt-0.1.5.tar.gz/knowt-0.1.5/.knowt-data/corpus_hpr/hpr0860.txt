## hpr0860 :: Kaizendo, GNU Parallel and some more FSCONS

 Interviews and a look at FSCONS 2011
Today you will hear two interviews from FSCONS 2010. The audio is of "conference quality", that is, there are a lot of noice in the background. Not much to do about that, I am sorry. But it is two really great interviews, so well worth it!
But as a start I have a look at what will take place during the coming FSCONS 2011, that will start 2011-11-11 and continue through the whole weekend. I read from the schedule, and mention some of the topics and presenters who will be there.

Salve J. Nilsen - Kaizendo: Customizable schoolboks
Imagine a schoolbook where the pupil and her teacher can choose the topic depth, clarity of text and homework difficulty as needed and necessary.
Add alternatives for teachers (supporting different instructional methods, teaching styles), schools (variations in chapter content based on time constraints or policy) and parents (having a topic summary to read before helping with homework.) This is what we mean with customizable textbooks.

Ole Tange - GNU Parallel
GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers. A job can be a single command or a small script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that reads from a pipe. GNU parallel can then split the input and pipe it into commands in parallel.
