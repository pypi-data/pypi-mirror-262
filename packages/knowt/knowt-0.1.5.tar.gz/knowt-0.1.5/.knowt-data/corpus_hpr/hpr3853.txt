## hpr3853 :: Creating a Prompt for ChatGPT to generate an HPR show

 Introduction
Hello and Welcome hacker public radio audience my name is â€¦ and
welcome to this podcast.
As usual I'd like to thank the people at HPR for making this service
available to us all on these here inter-tubes. Hacker Public Radio is a
community led podcast provided by the community for the community. That
means you can contribute too.
In this episode I decided to see if I could get get ChatGPT to write
an HPR episode about itself. I was initially reluctant to do this.
However, since HPR was recently short on shows and I was rather short on
time and ideas I decided to give it a go.
One reason for my reluctance was that I didn't want HPR to be flooded
with shows generated by ChatGPT. The other reason being that a great
show covering ChatGPT was previously provided by the hpr host "dnt"
entitled "Chatbot hallucination". Refer to 3803 https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=3803.
In comparison, my poor attempt took about 10 minutes to generate while I
was waiting to be called for lunch.
Below are the steps I used to generate the prompt to generate a show
for HPR.
You interface with ChatGPT by providing it prompts. This just means
typing some text into the input field within the ChatGPT website.
The steps I used
to produce the ChatGPT prompt
Here is how I did it. Keep in mind that the complete process took
just 10 minutes.

I visited the ChatGPT website at:- https://chatgpt.org/
I copied and pasted the following prompt into ChatGPT. The text
for this prompt came from the following youtube video: "The ONE ChatGPT
Prompt to Rule Them All" by Jason West  :-

I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me
craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by
you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:

Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be
about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through
continual iterations by going through the next steps.
Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.
a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear,
concise, and easily understood by you),
b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the
prompt to improve it), and
c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what
additional information is needed from me to improve the
prompt).
We will continue this iterative process with me providing
additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised
prompt section until it's complete.



ChatGPT responded with:-

Sounds like a fun and collaborative process! What should the prompt
be about?

I replied with the
following prompt:-

Write a show for the hacker public radio podcast describing the
history and use of ChatGPT. Include some examples about what it can be
used for. Also include some relevant web links about ChatGPT.

ChatGPT responded with:-

Great! Based on your input, here are the revised prompt, suggestions,
and questions for further clarification:

Revised prompt:

Create a Hacker Public Radio podcast episode that explores the
history and applications of ChatGPT. Share examples of how ChatGPT can
be used and include relevant web links for listeners to learn more.

Suggestions:

Consider including information about the development of ChatGPT,
such as who created it and when.
Provide clear and concise examples of how ChatGPT can be used in
various industries and fields, such as customer service, content
creation, and chatbots.
Highlight the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT, including
its ability to learn and adapt to user inputs and the potential ethical
concerns surrounding its use.
Provide relevant web links, such as the official OpenAI website and
articles about the latest developments in ChatGPT technology.

Questions:

Is there a specific angle or focus you want to take in exploring the
history and applications of ChatGPT?
Do you have any specific examples or use cases of ChatGPT that you
would like to be included in the podcast episode?
How technical should the podcast be? Should it cater to a more
general audience or dive into more technical details?

I replied with the
following prompt:-

Create a Hacker Public Radio podcast episode that explores the
history and applications of ChatGPT. Share examples of how ChatGPT can
be used and include relevant web links for listeners to learn

The show is mainly aimed at hobbyist. Many of the listeners will
have Linux experience and IT experience. Some listeners may have some
programming experience.
The article should cater for both a general audience while also
diving into more technical details.
Format the article using markdown as required.

ChatGPT responded with:-
Revised prompt:

Create a Hacker Public Radio podcast episode exploring the history
and applications of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model
developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT has become increasingly popular due to its
ability to understand and generate human-like text, and its applications
span a wide range of industries and fields.
In this episode, we will dive into the development of ChatGPT,
including who created it and when. We will explore the technology behind
it and how it has evolved over time.


We will also provide clear and concise examples of how ChatGPT can be
used in various industries and fields, such as customer service, content
creation, and chatbots. For example, ChatGPT can be used to generate
personalized responses to customer inquiries in real-time, create
high-quality content for websites and social media platforms, and power
chatbots that can assist with a range of tasks.
Additionally, we will highlight the benefits and limitations of using
ChatGPT, including its ability to learn and adapt to user inputs and the
potential ethical concerns surrounding its use. As ChatGPT continues to
grow in popularity, it is important to consider the implications of
using AI technology that can generate human-like text, such as the
potential for bias and misinformation.
To provide listeners with more information, we will include relevant
web links, such as the official OpenAI website and articles about the
latest developments in ChatGPT technology.
This episode will cater to a general audience while also diving into
more technical details for listeners with Linux, IT, or programming
experience. The article will be formatted using markdown as
required.

Suggestions:

Consider including interviews with experts in the field of AI or
individuals who have used ChatGPT in their work.
Provide real-world examples of how ChatGPT has been used in various
industries and fields.
Discuss the potential future applications of ChatGPT and where the
technology may be headed.
Address any common misconceptions or concerns about the use of AI
language models like ChatGPT.

Questions:

Is there a specific length you would like the podcast episode to
be?
Are there any specific individuals or companies you would like us to
feature in the episode?
Is there any particular tone or style you would like us to use for
the podcast episode?



I stopped at this point and decided not to take on board any
further suggestions or refinements. As I mentioned at the beginning this
whole process probably took no longer than 10mins.
I will provide the show generated by ChatGPT in my next
episode.
