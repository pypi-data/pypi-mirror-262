## hpr0962 :: LiTS 004: paste

 
In the fourth in his series Dann, shows us the benefits of the paste command:

The paste command merges the lines of two or more files or a file and standard in if a second file is not specified or a "-" is used in place of the second file. Consider the following two files. The first file, test1.txt contains the following lines:
a
one
three
cat
good
The second file, test2.txt contains the following lines:
tuna
blue finch
dogs
fish
eats
The paste command can be used to paste these two files like so:
paste test1.txt test2.txt
producing the following output:
a         tuna
one     blue finch
three   dogs
cat      fish
good   eats
Each line in test1.txt has been “pasted” to the corresponding line in test2.txt.
