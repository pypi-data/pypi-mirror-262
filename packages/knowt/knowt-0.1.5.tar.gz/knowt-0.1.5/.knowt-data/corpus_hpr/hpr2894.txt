## hpr2894 :: Repairing a Musical Instrument Case

 In this episode I talk about repairing the case for a Vietnamese Đàn tranh, a zither-like instrument which was donated to the School of Music by a member of the community. I also demonstrate the instrument as best I can so that you can hear what it sounds like.
