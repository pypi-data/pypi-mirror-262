## hpr1811 :: Life and Times of a Geek part 2

 Introduction
In the last part I told you of my first encounter with a mainframe computer and the Algol60 language while an undergraduate student at Aberystwyth University.
Today I want to talk about the next stage as a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester.
It seems to have taken me over 6 months to prepare this episode of this series, for which I apologise. I seem to get distracted as I do my background research.
