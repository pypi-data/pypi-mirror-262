## hpr1307 :: What's in my Bag

 
In this show, I tell you all about my bag. I start with the back compartment, and work my way to the front, so from magnetic card to keys on a tether. I carry a 1 Terabyte drive with me, which is a full backup of my computer. This is a weak version of offsite backup because sometimes it is not offsite. I have no office or other place where I can store it, though. It's better than nothing. One recommendation I do make is to carry a jeweler's loupe. They are not that expensive and can make it possible to read tiny model numbers on parts or just tiny print.


Listeners, this is my second attempt at a show. It's not that hard, and I would like to hear from others about what's in their bag.
