## hpr3206 :: Dungeons and Dragons for the blind

 Dungeons and Dragons, and most tabletop roleplaying games, are ideal platforms for players with low or no vision. However, because most players are sighted, you have to work-around some assumptions made by the rulebooks.
I [currently] have vision, but I have played with a blind player before, and I've played as a Dungeon Master with no materials on hand. In this episode, I discuss some easy workarounds to make tabletop RPGs easy for both sighted and non-sighted players.

There are audiobook versions of the rule books available at https://listenrpg.com.
The official D&D digital platform is dndbeyond.com, and it is accessible to blind players using a screen reader.
Wizards of the Coast publishes the basic rules under the Open Game License (OGL). As a service to my players, I maintain a version of this document in plain text, with third-party OGL additions. It may or may not be useful for screen readers, depending on your workflow.
