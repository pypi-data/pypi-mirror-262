## hpr2881 :: Automatically split album into tracks in Audacity

 
In this show Ken, recalls hpr1771 :: Audacity: Label Tracks by Jon Kulp to add Labels to an large audio file.


Tidy up the audio to the point where you are happy with it, but do not truncate silence.
Find the first break in the audio and check how long it is. In my case it was 4 seconds.
Select the entire track and select Analyze>Silence Finder
Change Maximum duration of silence to just under the length of the break. In my case I set it to 3 seconds
This will then create a series of labels on a new Label track
Edit the names of each as desired.
Select File > Export > Export Multiple
Select Split Files based on Labels
Name files using Label/Track Name
