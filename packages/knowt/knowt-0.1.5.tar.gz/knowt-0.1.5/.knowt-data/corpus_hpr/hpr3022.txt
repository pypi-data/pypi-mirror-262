0 A.D.


0 A.D. is a free and open-source, real-time strategy game under development by Wildfire Games. It is a historical war and economy game focusing on the years between 500 BC and 1 BC for the first part, and a planned second part for the years 1 AD to 500 AD. The game is cross-platform, playable on Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, Linux, and OpenBSD. It aims to be entirely free and open-source, using the GPLv2+ license for the game engine and CC BY-SA for the game art. 


Wildfire Games is a global group of volunteer game developers. We create open source games and mods.

Apache Camel


Apache Camel is an open source framework for message-oriented middleware with a rule-based routing and mediation engine that provides a Java object-based implementation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns using an application programming interface (or declarative Java domain-specific language) to configure routing and mediation rules. The domain-specific language means that Apache Camel can support type-safe smart completion of routing rules in an integrated development environment using regular Java code without large amounts of XML configuration files, though XML configuration inside Spring Framework is also supported. Camel is often used with Apache ServiceMix, Apache ActiveMQ and Apache CXF in service-oriented architecture projects.

KubeVirt and Metal3


Virtual Machine Management on Kubernetes. Building a virtualization API for Kubernetes. KubeVirt technology addresses the needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt Kubernetes but possess existing Virtual Machine-based workloads that cannot be easily containerized. More specifically, the technology provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both Application Containers as well as Virtual 



There are a number of great open source tools for bare metal host provisioning, including Ironic. Metal3.io aims to build on these technologies to provide a Kubernetes native API for managing bare metal hosts via a provisioning stack that is also running on Kubernetes. We believe that Kubernetes Native Infrastructure, or managing your infrastructure just like your applications, is a powerful next step in the evolution of infrastructure management.
