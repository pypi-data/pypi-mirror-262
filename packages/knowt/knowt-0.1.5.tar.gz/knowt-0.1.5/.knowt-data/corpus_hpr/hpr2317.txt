 Bash snippet - extglob and scp
The Problem
Following on from my last show on filename expansion, concentrating on extended patterns and the extglob option, I was asked a question by Jon Kulp in the comment section.
Jon was using ls *(*.mp3|*.ogg) to find all OGG and MP3 files in a directory which also held other files. However, when he wanted to copy this subset of files elsewhere he had problems using this expression in an scp command.
Having done some investigations to help solve this I thought I'd put what I found into an HPR episode and share it, and this is the show.
Along the way clacke commented too and this led me to more investigations!
Long notes
As often happens, my idea of a brief episode turned into something much longer, so I converted the notes into long notes which you can find here. In them I have marked some sections which you might want to skip over -- unless you are as much of a geek as I am! I have not covered these sections in detail in the audio.
