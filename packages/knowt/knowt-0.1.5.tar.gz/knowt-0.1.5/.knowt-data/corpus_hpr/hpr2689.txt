## hpr2689 :: Bash Tips - 14

 Bash Tips - 14 (Some auxiliary Bash tips)
More about loops
This is the fourteenth episode covering useful tips about using Bash. Episodes 9-13 covered Making Decisions in Bash and in these episodes we looked at while and until loops, but not for loops. This episode is making good this deficiency, and is also looking at break and continue which are very useful when using loops.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
