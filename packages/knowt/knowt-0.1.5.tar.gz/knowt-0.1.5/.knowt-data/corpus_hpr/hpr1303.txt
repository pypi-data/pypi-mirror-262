## hpr1303 :: A Music Pairing Under Unlikely Circumstances

 
Today Dave interviews Tim, his son, and Tim's friend John, who is
visiting from the USA.


Tim and John met on the Internet in 2006 as collaborating composers of
electronic music. They have become good friends over the years; Tim has
visited John in the States, in 2011 where they met for the first time in real
life, for John's wedding. This also marks the first time that John and his
wife Caitlin have travelled overseas, which they did to visit Tim in the UK.


In the podcast we discuss how they met, how their different world
views affected each other, and how their relationship quickly
transcended music.


Here's a picture of Tim and John visiting Edinburgh Castle in July
2013:





Contrary to what was said in the podcast, Tim prepared a mix of the
various compositions he and John have made. Links to some of the full
tracks are available below.


Here are Tim's notes for the music mix:
