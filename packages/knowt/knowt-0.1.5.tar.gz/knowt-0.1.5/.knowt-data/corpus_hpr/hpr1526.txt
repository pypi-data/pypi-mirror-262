## hpr1526 :: Penguicon 2014

 Show notes: In late fall 2013 I became involved in the Penguicon
 convention, which combines Open Source technology with Science Fiction to
 create something that I believe to be unique. I ended up taking
 responsibility for organizing the Tech Track, and we ended up with around 70
 hours of programming. I recap some of the highlights of my own personal
 experience of this event, both as a participant and as an organizer.
