## hpr0461 :: Mibbit

 ThistleWeb discusses why you should have an embedded Mibbit client on your projects home page.

Users needn't know about IRC or have a client installed.
Users can connect from any PC, regardless of restrictions with only a web browser.
Real time language translation allows you to vault over the langauge barrier and be properly international, regardless of the size of your userbase.
Pastebin is only a click away, for those times where you need to share or see code / logfiles etc
