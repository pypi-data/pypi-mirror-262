## hpr1298 :: Recording for HPR using Audacity

 
The almost failsafe short of it. Use "alsamixer" to boost all recording
volumes on main pulse and all cards (e.g. "alsamixer -c 0"). Start Audacity,
edit -> preferences, stay in the "device" submenu, don't bother with the
"recording" submenu. For each of the "Hosts" (alsa/jack), try all "Device"s
under the "Recording" tab, start speaking, notice volume (or not and try
the next one)
