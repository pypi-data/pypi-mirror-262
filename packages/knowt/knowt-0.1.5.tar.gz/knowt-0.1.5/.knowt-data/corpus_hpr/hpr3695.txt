 How I watch youtube with newsboat
I find that the youtube web ui is designed to keep users on the site by feeding them an unending stream of information. Bright colors, distracting thumbnails, peanut galleries, etc. I prefer to consume my videos in the same way I consume everything else: via RSS.
RSS is my favorite way of aggregating things that other people have made because it allows me, the user, to interact with their things
The only dependencies not on a standard UNIX system are newsboat and a video player. I also use yt-dlp to download videos for later viewing. I like mpv but you can substitute your own.
$ sudo $pkgmrg install newsboat mpv yt-dlp
Getting RSS feeds from youtube
Youtube (currently) provides RSS feeds for channels.
Finding Youtube channel ID
Sometimes channels have vanity URLs that can make it difficult to find the channel ID. Other times, the URL contains the channel ID. All youtube channel IDs start with the string UC so we can easily grep for them.
$ curl https://www.youtube.com/c/RMCRetro | grep --color "href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC\""
[ lots of nonsense ]
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLEoyoOKZK0idGqSc6Pi23w"
[ lots of nonsense ]
In order to turn this channel ID into something useful, we create the following URL:
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCLEoyoOKZK0idGqSc6Pi23w
Google takeout can also be used to export youtube subscriptions.
The export format is a CSV that contains the channel IDs for all of our subscriptions.
Channel Id,Channel Url,Channel Title
UCLEoyoOKZK0idGqSc6Pi23w,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLEoyoOKZK0idGqSc6Pi23w,RMC - The Cave
Newsboat url list
Newsboat reads itâ€™s list of URLs from ~/.config/newsboat/urls. Every url we add to this list will be automaticlly fetched. You can make separate URL lists for your list of videos and list of standard text based RSS feeds
If you have an exported CSV, you can easily modify it so that newsboat will accept it as a list of URLs by deleting row 1, column 1+comma, and replacing the comma between the URL and channel name with a tab character. Doing a sed 's/channel\//feeds\/videos.xml?channel_id=/g' on the file is an easy way to replace the website URL with the feed url. Newsboat only reads the first field of every row so the channel name can be kept for easier subscription management.

Newsboat config
In order to play videos, we need to add some macros to the newsboat config file at ~/.config/newsboat/config
Mine looks like this.
# load URLS on launch
auto-reload  yes

# vim binds
bind-key j down
bind-key k up
bind-key j next articlelist
bind-key k prev articlelist
bind-key J next-feed articlelist
bind-key K prev-feed articlelist
bind-key G end
bind-key g home
bind-key d pagedown
bind-key u pageup
bind-key l open
bind-key h quit
bind-key a toggle-article-read
bind-key n next-unread
bind-key N prev-unread
bind-key D pb-download
bind-key U bashow-urls
bind-key x pb-delete

This is a demo of using newsboat with videos. In order to execute the macros, you type , then v or whatever other letter you set the macro to.
