In this episode, Martin and Chris take a closer look at twenty years of Linux Inlaws
history. Why, you may ask, given the fact that this podcast has only been in existence
for roughly over two years, are we reviewing this history? The answer - of course - is
straight forward: by sheer coincidence our two heroes got hold of a future episode
which traveled back in time from the future. If you ever wondered about time-travel,
the paradoxes associated with this and what the next twenty years have in store not
just from a Linux Inlaws perspective, this episode is for you.
