Linux from scratch


Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a type of a Linux installation and the name of a book written by Gerard Beekmans, among others. The book gives readers instructions on how to build a Linux system from source. The book is available freely from the Linux From Scratch site and is currently in version 7.8.

Linux From Scratch is a way to install a working Linux system by building all components of it manually. This is, naturally, a longer process than installing a pre-compiled Linux distribution. According to the Linux From Scratch site, the advantages to this method are a compact, flexible and secure system and a greater understanding of the internal workings of the Linux-based operating systems.
