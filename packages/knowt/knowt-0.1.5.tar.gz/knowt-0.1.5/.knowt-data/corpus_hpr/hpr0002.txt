## hpr0002 :: Customization the Lost Reason

 Today deepgeek talks about Customization being the lost reason in switching from windows to Linux. He points out that the PC stands for Personal Computer. To many on windows this means they can change the desktop wallpaper. 
He believes that by explaining the ability to Customise the working environment is the power of Linux. You can customise the services running, whether you wish to use a command line interface, a basic Window Manager, or a Lightweight or Full Featured Desktop Environment
Finally he ends with a tribute to Seymour Cray
