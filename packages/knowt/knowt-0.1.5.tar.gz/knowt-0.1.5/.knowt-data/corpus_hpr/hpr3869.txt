## hpr3869 :: 5 minute war game

 Grab some toy soldiers (Games Workshop, BattleTech, Lego, whatever), a handful of six-sided dice, and clear off a 20x20 cm space on your desk.
Arrange the soldiers within the play area. Place 3d6 by each soldier.
On its turn, a soldier may move or attack. Never both.
To attack, remove 1d6 from a soldier's dice pool and roll it. Ranged attacks hit on 4 or greater. Melee attacks hit on 3 or greater.
When a soldier takes damage, remove 1 die from its dice pool.
When a soldier's dice pool is reduced by damage to 0 or less, tip it on its side to signify that it is dead.
The last soldier or soldiers left standing when there are no dice in the play area wins.
