## hpr2702 :: Audacity set up and response to episode 2658

 Hi Guys and Girls in HPR land.
This is Tony Hughes in Blackpool in the UK back for another show. I normally talk about my own stuff but while it is related to what I have been doing lately this is a response to Al’s interview with Dave in Episode 2658 and how to setup Audacity to record and edit audio for best sound quality when podcasting.
I’ve recently joined the mintCast podcast team and have been editing and doing the post production of the audio recording for the last couple of episodes. The information that Dave provided during the show was invaluable in helping me in this task, I also have to give a shout out to Rob the previous host who also spent an hour and a half giving a tutorial on his post production work flow, but the additional information given by Dave in this show was also a big help.
I’ve now purchased a boom arm and pop filter for my mic to reduce any artefacts in the recording although as it is still attached to my desk I think I may need to invest in a shock mount although I’m not sure how it will attach to my current Boom arm. Ah well that’s a problem for another day.
As I said this was just a shout out to Al and Dave to say thanks for the show and I will save it for another day to do a show on my new post production work flow on the mintCast audio.
This is Tony Hughes saying goodbye for now.
