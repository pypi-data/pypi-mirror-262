## hpr3927 :: Audacity Update 20230702

 Audacity seems to have developed some sensitivity problems of late
and that has affected my ability to process my podcast files as
explained in HPR 3900. I have found some evidence that the Audacity team
is aware of this, but for now this is how I work around the problem.
