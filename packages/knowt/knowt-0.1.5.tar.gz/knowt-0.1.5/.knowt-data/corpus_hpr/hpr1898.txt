## hpr1898 :: Free my music!

 
How I got my music library transferred from my Mac to my Linux box, thereby allowing me to fully switch to Linux. This is a problem I've been neglecting for a while that has been keeping me tethered to iTunes whenever I want to hear my music. This probably isn't the best or simplest solution, but it's how I felt comfortable doing it.
