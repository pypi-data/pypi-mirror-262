## hpr2492 :: An Evening Subway Ride

 
An experiment in background noise.


Having seen so many people fall asleep on subway trains, I wonder if the sound only would also be somniferous.


Using my cellphone I recorded the ride (including boarding and alighting) on the Toronto subway (line 1) from College Station, north to Sheppard/Yonge Station.  There was always at least one person sleeping (or at least appearing to be asleep) during the ride.

So far, listening to the recording has not put me to sleep.
