## hpr0772 :: Circuit Bending

 I realize that what I have done is not
truly circuit bending, but I felt that it was interesting and 

was the closest related topic to my
hacking.  



Tools I have used:
Precission Screw drivers: flat,philips,
torx, triwing, and allen
knife or wire cutter
soldering iron
electrical tape
package of various resitors
varialbe resistors ( potentiometers)
Capacitors
super glue


Here are some links that may be useful for this type of hacking.
