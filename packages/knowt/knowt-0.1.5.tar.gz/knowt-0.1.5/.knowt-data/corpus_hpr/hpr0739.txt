The Knightcast KC0053 : Wirelessly syncing content to your Ipad and Ipod.


In this deep-geeky episode we unlock the secret of automatic podcast downloading and distribution to android and IOS Devices without using itunes or a cable. We mash together Ubuntu, Gpodder, a bash script a couple of SSH Connections and an Ipad app to unlock the secrets of wirelessly pushing content to your IOS Devices. As a bonus we take a glance at calibre and show you how to have your favorite rss feeds available to read offline.
