## hpr3387 :: Infosec Podcasts Part 5  Grab bag

 Inoffensive in every region of the world.
Thank you to everyone who has listened to my previous episodes. I hope I am not boring you all to death!
Why am I recording this series?

You can hear my reasoning for why I am making this series by listening to the introduction to any of the previous four episodes in this series. Yes, this is a shameless plug for you to listen to my other works.

Because there are so many podcasts to list, I have broken them down into 6 different episodes based on topics:

Part 1 - News & Current Events
Part 2 - General Information Security
Part 3 - Career & Personal Development
Part 4 - Social Engineering
Part 5 -

Hacks & Attacks
Technical Information & Learning
Infosec Community / Social / History

Part 6 - Infosec Leadership
