## hpr3096 :: Unscripted ramblings on a walk:  PC Building.

 I certainly want to say that this episode isn't a brag-a-thon about my new rig. I try to discuss what surprised me most about how PC building has changed in the last 10-15 years.
The parts for my build:

AMD Threadripper 1920X 3.5 GHz 12-Core Processor
ASRock X399 Taichi ATX sTR4 Motherboard
EVGA 850 B3, 80+ Bronze 850W, Fully Modular PSU
Noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3, Premium-Grade CPU Cooler
MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710
Fractal Design Define C case
Corsair LPX 32GB (2x16GB) 3200MHz C16 DDR4 DRAM Memory Kit
GELID GC-Extreme thermal paste
Random 500GB SSD from my parts bin
