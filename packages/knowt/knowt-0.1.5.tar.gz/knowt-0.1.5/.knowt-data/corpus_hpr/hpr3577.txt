## hpr3577 :: Hello and how I got into tech

 Hi, I'm Sarah. In this show, I introduce myself and ramble about how I got into tech. Despite saying I hate talking about myself, I managed 7 minutes and 25 seconds. I started as a kid with a Tandy and eventually ended up being a librarian and a sysadmin for a RedHat system.
