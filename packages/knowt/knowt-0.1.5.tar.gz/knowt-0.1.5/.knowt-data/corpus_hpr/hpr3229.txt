## hpr3229 :: Linux Inlaws S01E19: Redis

 In this episode our two heroes interview Itamar Haber, community liaison for Redis, a popular open-source
in-memory NoSQL database. Technology prevails in this episode; communism, free love and drugs
take a backseat (but only for the moment! :-). The trio discuss the legacy of redis, bemoan their old age
and reveal why Itamar initially wanted to be a mermaid. Listen to the episode
for more shocking epiphanies!
