## hpr2874 :: Repair of G.E. Variable Speed Cassette Recorder

 I found a pretty cool little handheld cassette recorder at Salvation Army Thrift Store for 99 cents yesterday. It was non-functioning. I was able to get it working again by 1. cleaning corrosion from battery compartment; 2. replacing the nasty gooey belt; 3.  repairing the battery compartment, which had a broken-off spring for one of the battery's negative connections. The most interesting feature of the device is that it has a variable-speed knob for playback at higher speed. I demonstrate this in the podcast.
