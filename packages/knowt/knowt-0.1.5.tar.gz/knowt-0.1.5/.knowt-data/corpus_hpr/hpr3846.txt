Unicode characters in shows
It came to light during the month that shows with Unicode characters
in their title, summary or notes were not being represented properly on
the website.
This is the definition of Unicode on Wikipedia:

Unicode, formally The Unicode Standard, is an information technology
standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of
text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. The standard,
which is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, defines as of the current
version (15.0) 149,186 characters covering 161 modern and historic
scripts, as well as symbols, thousands of emoji (including in colors),
and non-visual control and formatting codes.

The software and database behind the HPR website come from a time
before Unicode, but had been updated to use this encoding a number of
years ago. However, it was discovered that some changes had been
overlooked.
We are currently making changes to ensure that Unicode is properly
displayed on the web site, and in audio tags. It will be necessary to
find and correct encoding errors in the database, and this process will
be carried out as soon as possible. ✓
