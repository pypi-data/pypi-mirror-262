 Everything You Always Wanted to Know About PEX
Part 01- Let's Talk About PEX - Introduction
Why? My story

Why am I posting about plumbing on HPR? "Of interest to hackers"

I find it interesting
We like to learn new things
We like to understand

How things work
How things break
How to use non-standard approached to solve problems

Others can learn from my experience, troubleshooting process, etc...
I had fun creating the episode titles.

Pinhole leaks in copper pipe

Causes – Note plumbing is around 40 years old and original to house
Poor quality copper Shoddy installation
Failure to de-bur pipe before soldering
Not properly hung from joists

Pipe on pipe
Pipe on steel wire

Bad soldering technique

Lumpy solder
Flux residue
Excessive flux

Hard water

Only some neighbors experiencing the same issue, and their houses were constructed by the same builder.

High Water Pressure

Normal = 60-80 PSI
Tested at 63 PSI = GOOD!!

Damage
Water leaks caused damage to drywall in parts of my house and to items stored in my garage.
Leaks in some areas can sometimes go unidentified for long enough to do extensive damage and even lead to dangerous mold growth.

Possible solutions

Short term
Patch

Epoxy kits
Can be inconsistent
May not bond to corroded pipe
Some require turning off water and dry pipes
Water activated tape
Access around pipe
May not bond to corroded pipe
Some require turning off water and dry pipes
Solder on patch
Expensive
Requires clean dry pipe exterior
Requires draining the pipe
Might as well cut out the leaking section and replace
Repair Clamps
Fast
Strong
Can be used while pipe is under pressure
Minimal clearance needed

Long Term
Repair copper

Cut out damaged section and replace using SharkBite fittings
Expensive
Cut out damaged section and solder in new section of pipe
Expensive
Time consuming
Many areas of corrosion visible
Whack-a-mole - Where & when will next leak occur?

New copper

Expensive
Difficult
Time consuming

PVC

Still difficult – rigidity

PEX

Comparatively inexpensive
Flexible and easy to install
Can use existing copper pipe as support structure
Can completely redesign with a manifold
