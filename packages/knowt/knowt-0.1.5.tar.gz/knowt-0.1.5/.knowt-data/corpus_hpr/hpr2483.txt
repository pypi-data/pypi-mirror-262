 Useful Bash functions - part 4
Overview
This is the fourth show about the Bash functions I use, and it may be the last unless I come up with something else that I think might be of general interest.
There is only one function to look at this time, but it's fairly complex so needs an entire episode devoted to it.
As before it would be interesting to receive feedback on this function and would be great if other Bash users contributed ideas of their own.
Full Notes
Since the notes explaining this subject are long, they have been placed here.
