## hpr2305 :: Configuring an HP Laptop for Dual Boot Linux and Windows 10

 This presentation describes the installation of Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 to dual boot with Windows 10 Home on an HP Spectre x360-13 laptop. Previously, I had been using Linux in a virtual machine on Windows. After the update, there was a very significant improvement in performance working in Linux without the Windows/VM overhead. It turned out to not be difficult and was certainly worth doing.
