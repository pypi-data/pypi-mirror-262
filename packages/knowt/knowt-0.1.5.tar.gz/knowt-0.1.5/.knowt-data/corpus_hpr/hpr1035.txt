## hpr1035 :: OGG Camp 11 Panel Discussion

 Welcome to the Full Circle Podcast on Hacker Public Radio. This is the fourth of our highlights of last Summers unconference, OGG Camp-11, held at Farnham Maltings in the South of England.
Introducing Andy Piper on MQTT: MQ Telemetry Transport
MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers
