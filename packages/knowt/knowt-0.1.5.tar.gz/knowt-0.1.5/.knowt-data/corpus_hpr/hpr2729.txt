## hpr2729 :: Bash Tips - 18

 Bash Tips - 18 (Extra auxiliary Bash tips)
Arrays in Bash
This is the third of a small group of shows on the subject of arrays in Bash. It is also the eighteenth show in the Bash Tips sub-series.
In the last show we looked at ways of accessing elements with negative indices and how to concatenate arrays. We then launched into parameter expansion in the context of arrays.
There are a few more parameter expansion operations to look at in this episode, then in the next episode we will look in more depth at the declare built in command and at some of the commands that assist with loading data into arrays.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
