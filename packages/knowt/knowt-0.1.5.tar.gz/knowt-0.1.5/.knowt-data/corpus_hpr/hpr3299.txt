## hpr3299 :: Linux Inlaws S01E26: Make your Linux harder

 In this episode our two aging heroes discuss the proper temperature to
drink beer at (spoiler: it's not 20 degrees as CAMRA would make you believe)
and the ins and outs of basic and enhanced security on our beloved operating
system. If you ever wanted to know more about Linux Security Modules, AppArmor
and SELinux and how dames of negotiable affections relate to these concepts,
this show is for you.
