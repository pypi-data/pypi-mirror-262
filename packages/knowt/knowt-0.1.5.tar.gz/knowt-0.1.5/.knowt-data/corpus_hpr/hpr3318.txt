## hpr3318 :: Modding a Wii classic with a DNS exploit

 
Wii Options > Wii Settings
Verify version is 4.3

If not,
Is the Wii connected to the internet

Enter wifi connection info
perform Wii System Update (Page 3 of Wii Settings)


Wii Settings > Internet

Go to Change Settings
A few pages over is Auto-Obtain DNS

Select No and Advanced Settings
Enter Primary DNS: 97.74.103.14
Enter Secondary DNS: 173.201.71.14

Confirm and Save Settings
Press Ok to perform Connection Test
This does take a while, be patient because the Wii is slow
Go back a couple of pages to Internet Settings
Go to User Agreements

Would you like to use the Wii Shop Channel and WiiConnect24?
Select Yes
You must review the User Agreements before using the Wii network services.
Select Next
Connecting to Internet... Please wait a moment.
Another screen will appear with message to "Please wait, this will take 1-2 minutes."

Do NOT press I Accept at this point, or it will go to the previous screen.
These next two screens will show up, one with console text, which is the exploit, and the next look like static. This is ok
The next screen is a message not to be scammed by buying a copy of HackMii. Wait for the option to press '1' to continue.
The HackMii menu will now appear, press 'A' to continue.
On the HackMii installer screen, use the D-pad on the Wii to arrow up to Install The HomeBrew Channel.


At this point the Wii can be powered off.

Install Wii Homebrew Browser https://oscwii.org/

I have read that a 2gb non-hd sd card was needed, but found that up to a 32gb card works just fine.
Remove the sd card and download and extract the zip file on the main page.
Move the folder on the root of the sd card (i.e. apps/homebrew_browser/).
More applications can now be accessed from the Homebrew Browser.

Adding roms (i.e. Nintendo 64 games)

From the Homebrew Browser, add the not64 emulator, as the Wii64 would not save games for me. This is an updated version of the Wii64 emulator.
At the root of the sd card, if it is not already there, create a not64/roms folder and place the roms in here.

Play Wii games from a USB drive

First need to install cIOS (custom OS)

Will be installing:

cIOS 249 base 56 v10 beta52, some guides say cIOS 249 base 56 beta52-alt, YMMV.
cIOS 250 base 57 v10 beta52


From the Homebrew Browser, go to the Utilities tab and install USBLoader and the d2x cIOS installer.
Wait for the app to load.
You will see the main screen, press A

Change the following:

cIOS to v10 beta 52 d2x-v10-beta52-alt
base to 56
slot to 249
revision to 65535

Press A to load these values

The app will go back to the main screen, just go right back into the app.

Change the following:

cIOS to v10 beta 52 d2x-v10-beta52
base to 57
slot to 250
revision to 65535

Press A to load these values

You are now ready to format the external USB drive

This can be either FAT32 or ext4
Plug in the USB drive afterwards and load the USBloader
It only works in one USB slot, so if this is not recognized the first time, move the plug to the other slot.
Now you can save games from Wii disks, or load roms from the same drive
Roms are placed at the root of the USB drive with the format of /roms/


That's all.
