## hpr2759 :: Cleaning the Potentiometers on a Peavey Bandit 65

 Since my daughter has been learning a bit of guitar in the last several months, I've actually gotten my old electric guitar and amplifier back out again after many years in the closet. The amp is a Peavey Bandit 65, which was a an affordable solid-state workhorse kind of amp back in the mid-80s and I've had it since it was new. In this episode I talk through the process of removing the brains of the amp and cleaning the potentiometers to try to get rid of some of the static that's happening when I turn the knobs. I also discover belatedly that the reason I was not getting any distortion when I turned the saturation up was that the amp was stuck on the clean channel â€” shows how long it's been since I used the amp, I kind of forgot how the thing works!
