<h2>Chapter 6</h2>



<h1>Iteration</h1>

<h3>6.1 Multiple assignment</h3>
<p>
As you may have discovered, it is legal to
make more than one assignment to the same variable.  A
new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new
value (and stop referring to the old value).

<p><tt><font size=-1>bruce = 5
<br><font color=black>print</font> bruce,
<br>bruce = 7
<br><font color=black>print</font> bruce
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
The output of this program is <tt><font size=-1>5 7</font></tt>, because the first time
<tt><font size=-1>bruce</font></tt> is printed, his value is 5, and the second time, his
value is 7.  The
comma at the end of the first <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>print</font></font></tt> statement suppresses
the newline after the output, which is why both outputs
appear on the same line.
<p>
Here is what <b>multiple assignment</b> looks like in a state diagram:

<p align="center"><img src="illustrations/assign2.png"></p>
<p>
With multiple assignment it is especially important to distinguish
between an assignment operation and a statement of equality.  Because
Python uses the equal sign (<tt><font size=-1>=</font></tt>) for assignment, it is tempting to
interpret a statement like <tt><font size=-1>a = b</font></tt> as a statement of equality. It
is not!
<p>
First, equality is commutative and assignment is not.  For
example, in mathematics, if <tt>a = 7</tt> then <tt>7 = a</tt>.  But in Python, the
statement <tt><font size=-1>a = 7</font></tt> is legal and <tt><font size=-1>7 = a</font></tt> is not.
<p>
Furthermore, in mathematics, a statement of equality is always true.
If <tt>a = b</tt> now, then <tt>a</tt> will always equal <tt>b</tt>.  In Python, an
assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don't have
to stay that way:

<p><tt><font size=-1>a = 5
<br>b = a&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=#009000># a and b are now equal
</font><br>a = 3&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=#009000># a and b are no longer equal
</font><br></font></tt></p>

<p>
The third line changes the value of <tt><font size=-1>a</font></tt> but does not change the
value of <tt><font size=-1>b</font></tt>, so they are no longer equal. (In some
programming languages, a different symbol is used for assignment,
such as <tt><font size=-1>&lt;-</font></tt> or <tt><font size=-1>:=</font></tt>, to avoid confusion.)
<p>
Although multiple assignment is frequently helpful, you should use it
with caution.  If the values of variables change frequently, it can
make the code difficult to read and debug.

<h3>6.2 The <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>while</font></font></tt> statement</h3>
<p>
Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks.  Repeating
identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that
computers do well and people do poorly.
<p>
We have seen two programs, <tt><font size=-1>nLines</font></tt> and <tt><font size=-1>countdown</font></tt>, that use
recursion to perform repetition, which is also called <b>iteration</b>.
Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language
features to make it easier.  The first feature we are going to look
at is the <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>while</font></font></tt> statement.
<p>
Here is what <tt><font size=-1>countdown</font></tt> looks like with a 
<tt><font size=-1><font color=black>while</font></font></tt> statement:

<p><tt><font size=-1><font color=black>def</font> <font color=orange>countdown</font>(n):
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>while</font> n &gt; 0:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=black>print</font> n
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; n = n-1
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>print</font> <font color=red>"Blastoff!"</font>
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
Since we removed the recursive call, this function is not
recursive.
<p>
You can almost read the <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>while</font></font></tt> statement as if it were English.
It means, "While <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> is greater than 0, continue
displaying the value of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> and then reducing the value of
<tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> by 1.  When you get to 0, display the word <tt><font size=-1>Blastoff!</font></tt>"
<p>
More formally, here is the flow of execution for a <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>while</font></font></tt> statement:

<ol>
<li>Evaluate the condition, yielding <tt><font size=-1>0</font></tt> or <tt><font size=-1>1</font></tt>.</li>
<li>If the condition is false (0), exit the <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>while</font></font></tt> statement
and continue execution at the next statement.</li>
<li>If the condition is true (1), execute each of the statements in the
body and then go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The body consists of all of the statements below the header
with the same indentation.
<p>
This type of flow is called a <b>loop</b> because the third step
loops back around to the top.  Notice that if the condition is false
the first time through the loop, the statements inside the loop are
never executed.
<p>
The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables
so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop
terminates.  Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called
an <b>infinite loop</b>.  An endless source of amusement for computer
scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo,
"Lather, rinse, repeat," are an infinite loop.
<p>
In the case of <tt><font size=-1>countdown</font></tt>, we can prove that the loop
terminates because we know that the value of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> is finite, and we
can see that the value of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> gets smaller each time through the
loop, so eventually we have to get to 0.  In other
cases, it is not so easy to tell:

<p><tt><font size=-1><font color=black>def</font> <font color=orange>sequence</font>(n):
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>while</font> n != 1:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=black>print</font> n,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=black>if</font> n%2 == 0:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=#009000># n is even
</font><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; n = n/2
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=black>else</font>:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=#009000># n is odd
</font><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; n = n*3+1
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
The condition for this loop is <tt><font size=-1>n != 1</font></tt>, so the loop will continue until
<tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> is <tt><font size=-1>1</font></tt>, which will make the condition false.
<p>
Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt>
and then checks whether it is even or odd.  If it is even, the value
of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> is divided by 2.  If it is odd, the value is replaced by
<tt><font size=-1>n*3+1</font></tt>. For example, if the starting value (the argument passed
to <tt><font size=-1>sequence</font></tt>) is 3, the resulting sequence is 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
<p>
Since <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no
obvious proof that <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> will ever reach 1, or that the program
terminates.  For some particular values of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt>, we can prove
termination.  For example, if the starting value is a power of two,
then the value of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt> will be even each time through the loop
until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence,
starting with 16.
<p>
Particular values aside, the interesting question is whether we can
prove that this program terminates for <i>all positive values</i> of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt>.
So far, no one has been able to prove it <i>or</i> disprove it!

<a href="chap04.html#9">Section 4.9</a> using iteration instead of recursion.</i>

<h3>6.3 Tables</h3>
<p>
One of the things loops are good for is generating tabular data.
Before computers were readily available, people had to calculate
logarithms, sines and cosines, and other mathematical functions
by hand.  To make that easier, mathematics books contained long tables
listing the values of these functions.  Creating the tables was
slow and boring, and they tended to be full of errors.
<p>
When computers appeared on the scene, one of the initial reactions
was, "This is great!  We can use the computers to generate the tables,
so there will be no errors." That turned out to be true (mostly) but
shortsighted.  Soon thereafter, computers and calculators were so
pervasive that the tables became obsolete.
<p>
Well, almost.  For some operations, computers use
tables of values to get an approximate answer and then perform
computations to improve the approximation.  In some cases, there have
been errors in the underlying tables, most famously in the table the
Intel Pentium used to perform floating-point division.
<p>
Although a log table is not as useful as it once was, it still makes
a good example of iteration.  The following program outputs a sequence
of values in the left column and their logarithms in the right column:

<p><tt><font size=-1>x = 1.0
<br><font color=black>while</font> x &lt; 10.0:
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>print</font> x, <font color=red>'\t'</font>, math.log(x)
<br>&nbsp; x = x + 1.0
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
The string 
<tt><font size=-1><font color=red>'\t'</font></font></tt> represents a <b>tab</b>
character.
<p>
As characters and strings are displayed on the screen,
an invisible marker called the <b>cursor</b> keeps track of
where the next character will go.  After a <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>print</font></font></tt> statement, the
cursor normally goes to the beginning of the next line.
<p>
The tab character shifts the cursor to the right until it
reaches one of the tab stops.  Tabs are useful for making columns of
text line up, as in the output of the previous program:

<p><tt><font size=-1>1.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0
<br>2.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.69314718056
<br>3.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.09861228867
<br>4.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.38629436112
<br>5.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.60943791243
<br>6.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.79175946923
<br>7.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.94591014906
<br>8.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.07944154168
<br>9.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.19722457734
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
If these values seem odd, remember that the <tt><font size=-1>log</font></tt> function uses
base <tt><font size=-1>e</font></tt>. Since powers of two are so important in computer
science, we often want to find logarithms with respect to base 2.  To
do that, we can use the following formula:

<p>
<table align=center><tr><td><tt>
log<sub>2</sub> x = <table style="display: inline; align: center; vertical-align: middle;"><tr><td>log<sub>e</sub> x</td></tr><tr><td><hr noshade color=black></td></tr><tr><td>log<sub>e</sub> 2</td></tr></table>
</tt></td></tr></table>


<p>
Changing the output statement to:

<p><tt><font size=-1>&nbsp; &nbsp;<font color=black>print</font> x, <font color=red>'\t'</font>,&nbsp; math.log(x)/math.log(2.0)
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
yields:

<p><tt><font size=-1>1.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0
<br>2.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.0
<br>3.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.58496250072
<br>4.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.0
<br>5.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.32192809489
<br>6.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.58496250072
<br>7.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.80735492206
<br>8.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.0
<br>9.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.16992500144
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
We can see that 1, 2, 4, and 8 are powers of two because their
logarithms base 2 are round numbers.  If we wanted to find the
logarithms of other powers of two, we could modify the program like
this:

<p><tt><font size=-1>x = 1.0
<br><font color=black>while</font> x &lt; 100.0:
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>print</font> x, <font color=red>'\t'</font>, math.log(x)/math.log(2.0)
<br>&nbsp; x = x * 2.0
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
Now instead of adding something to <tt><font size=-1>x</font></tt> each time through the loop, which
yields an arithmetic sequence, we multiply <tt><font size=-1>x</font></tt> by something, yielding a
geometric sequence.  The result is:

<p><tt><font size=-1>1.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0
<br>2.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.0
<br>4.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.0
<br>8.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3.0
<br>16.0&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.0
<br>32.0&nbsp; &nbsp; 5.0
<br>64.0&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.0
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
Because of the tab characters between the columns, the position of the
second column does not depend on the number of digits in the first
column.
<p>
Logarithm tables may not be useful any more, but for computer
scientists, knowing the powers of two is!

<blockquote><i>As an exercise, modify this program so that it outputs the powers
of two up to 65,536 (that's <tt>2<sup>16</sup></tt>).  Print it out and memorize it.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
The backslash character in <tt><font size=-1><font color=red>'\t'</font></font></tt> indicates the
beginning of an <b>escape sequence</b>.  Escape sequences
are used to represent invisible characters like
tabs and newlines.  The sequence <tt><font size=-1>\n</font></tt> represents a newline.
<p>
An escape sequence can appear
anywhere in a string; in the example, the tab escape
sequence is the only thing in the string.
<p>
How do you think you represent a backslash in a string?

<blockquote><i>As an exercise, write a single string that

<p><tt><font size=-1>produces
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; output.
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>

<h3>6.4 Two-dimensional tables</h3>
<p>
A two-dimensional table is a table where you
read the value at the intersection of a row and a column.  A
multiplication table is a good example.
Let's say you want to print a multiplication table for the values
from 1 to 6.
<p>
A good way to start is to write a loop that prints the multiples of
2, all on one line:

<p><tt><font size=-1>i = 1
<br><font color=black>while</font> i &lt;= 6:
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>print</font> 2*i, <font color=red>'&nbsp; &nbsp;'</font>,
<br>&nbsp; i = i + 1
<br><font color=black>print</font>
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
The first line initializes a variable named <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt>, which acts as a
counter or <b>loop variable</b>.  As the loop executes, the value of
<tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> increases from 1 to 6.  When <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> is 7, the loop
terminates.  Each time through the loop, it displays the value of <tt><font size=-1>2*i</font></tt>, followed by three spaces.  
<p>
Again, the comma in the <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>print</font></font></tt> statement suppresses the newline.
After the loop completes, the second <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>print</font></font></tt> statement starts a
new line.
<p>
The output of the program is:

<p><tt><font size=-1>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
So far, so good. The next step is to <b>encapsulate</b> and <b>generalize</b>.

<a name=5></a>
<h3>6.5 Encapsulation and generalization</h3>
<p>
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping a piece of code in a
function, allowing you to take advantage of all the things functions
are good for.  You have seen two examples of encapsulation:
<tt><font size=-1>printParity</font></tt> in <a href="chap04.html#5">Section 4.5</a>; and
<tt><font size=-1>isDivisible</font></tt> in <a href="chap05.html#4">Section 5.4</a>.
<p>
Generalization means taking something specific, such as printing the
multiples of 2, and making it more general, such as printing the
multiples of any integer.
<p>
This function encapsulates the previous loop and
generalizes it to print multiples of <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt>:

<p><tt><font size=-1><font color=black>def</font> <font color=orange>printMultiples</font>(n):
<br>&nbsp; i = 1
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>while</font> i &lt;= 6:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=black>print</font> n*i, <font color=red>'\t'</font>,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; i = i + 1
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>print</font>
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
To encapsulate, all we had to do was add the first line, which
declares the name of the function and the parameter list.  To
generalize, all we had to do was replace the value 2 with the
parameter <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt>.
<p>
If we call this function with the argument 2, we get the same output as
before.  With the argument 3, the output is:

<p><tt><font size=-1>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
With the argument 4, the output is:

<p><tt><font size=-1>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
By now you can probably guess how to print a multiplication table <s>&nbsp; &nbsp;</s> by
calling <tt><font size=-1>printMultiples</font></tt> repeatedly with different arguments.  In
fact, we can use another loop:

<p><tt><font size=-1>i = 1
<br><font color=black>while</font> i &lt;= 6:
<br>&nbsp; printMultiples(i)
<br>&nbsp; i = i + 1
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
Notice how similar this loop is to the one inside
<tt><font size=-1>printMultiples</font></tt>.  All we did was replace the <tt><font size=-1><font color=black>print</font></font></tt> statement with
a function call.
<p>
The output of this program is a multiplication table:

<p><tt><font size=-1>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6
<br>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12
<br>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18
<br>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24
<br>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30
<br>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;36
<br></font></tt></p>


<a name=6></a>
<h3>6.6 More encapsulation</h3>
<p>
To demonstrate encapsulation again, let's take the code from the end of
<a href="chap06.html#5">Section 6.5</a> and wrap it up in a function:

<p><tt><font size=-1><font color=black>def</font> <font color=orange>printMultTable</font>():
<br>&nbsp; i = 1
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>while</font> i &lt;= 6:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; printMultiples(i)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; i = i + 1
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
This process is a common <b>development plan</b>.  We develop code by
writing lines of code outside any function, or typing them in to the
interpreter.  When we get the code working, we extract it and wrap it
up in a function.
<p>
This development plan is particularly useful if you don't know, when
you start writing, how to divide the program into functions.  This
approach lets you design as you go along.

<a name=7></a>
<h3>6.7 Local variables</h3>
<p>
You might be wondering how we can use the same variable, <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt>, in
both <tt><font size=-1>printMultiples</font></tt> and <tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt>.  Doesn't it cause
problems when one of the functions changes the value of the variable?
<p>
The answer is no, because the <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> in <tt><font size=-1>printMultiples</font></tt> and the
<tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> in <tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt> are <i>not</i> the same variable.
<p>
Variables created inside a function definition are local; you can't
access a local variable from outside its "home" function.  That
means you are free to have multiple variables with the same name as
long as they are not in the same function.
<p>
The stack diagram for this program shows that the two
variables named <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> are not the same variable.  They can refer to
different values, and changing one does not affect the other.

<p align="center"><img src="illustrations/stack4.png"></p>
<p>
The value of <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> in <tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt> goes from 1 to 6.  In the
diagram it happens to be 3.  The next time through the loop it will
be 4.  Each time through the loop, <tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt> calls
<tt><font size=-1>printMultiples</font></tt> with the current value of <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> as an
argument.  That value gets assigned to the parameter <tt><font size=-1>n</font></tt>.
<p>
Inside <tt><font size=-1>printMultiples</font></tt>, the value of <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> goes from
1 to 6.  In the diagram, it happens to be 2.  Changing this variable
has no effect on the value of <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> in <tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt>.
<p>
It is common and perfectly legal to have different local variables
with the same name.  In particular, names like <tt><font size=-1>i</font></tt> and <tt><font size=-1>j</font></tt> are
used frequently as loop variables.  If you avoid
using them in one function just because you used them somewhere else,
you will probably make the program harder to read.

<a name=8></a>
<h3>6.8 More generalization</h3>
<p>
As another example of generalization, imagine you wanted a program
that would print a multiplication table of any size, not just the
six-by-six table. You could add a parameter to <tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt>:

<p><tt><font size=-1><font color=black>def</font> <font color=orange>printMultTable</font>(high):
<br>&nbsp; i = 1
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>while</font> i &lt;= high:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; printMultiples(i)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; i = i + 1
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
We replaced the value 6 with the parameter <tt><font size=-1>high</font></tt>.  If we call
<tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt> with the argument 7, it displays:

<p><tt><font size=-1>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6
<br>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12
<br>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18
<br>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24
<br>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30
<br>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;36
<br>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;21&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;28&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;35&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;42
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
This is fine, except that we probably want the table to be
square <s>&nbsp; &nbsp;</s> with the same number of rows and columns.  To do that, we
add another parameter to <tt><font size=-1>printMultiples</font></tt> to specify how many
columns the table should have.
<p>
Just to be annoying, we call this parameter <tt><font size=-1>high</font></tt>, demonstrating
that different functions can have parameters with the same name (just like
local variables).  Here's the whole program:

<p><tt><font size=-1><font color=black>def</font> <font color=orange>printMultiples</font>(n, high):
<br>&nbsp; i = 1
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>while</font> i &lt;= high:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=black>print</font> n*i, <font color=red>'\t'</font>,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; i = i + 1
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>print
<br>
<br>def</font> printMultTable(high):
<br>&nbsp; i = 1
<br>&nbsp; <font color=black>while</font> i &lt;= high:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; printMultiples(i, high)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; i = i + 1
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
Notice that when we added a new parameter, we had to change the first line
of the function (the function heading), and we also had to change the place
where the function is called in <tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt>.
<p>
As expected, this program generates a square seven-by-seven table:

<p><tt><font size=-1>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7
<br>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;14
<br>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;21
<br>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;28
<br>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;35
<br>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;36&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;42
<br>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;21&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;28&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;35&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;42&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;49
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
When you generalize a function appropriately, you often get
a program with capabilities you didn't plan.  For
example, you might
notice that, because <tt>ab = ba</tt>,
all the entries in the table appear twice.  You could save ink by printing
only half the table.  To do that, you only have to change one line of
<tt><font size=-1>printMultTable</font></tt>.  Change

<p><tt><font size=-1>&nbsp; &nbsp; printMultiples(i, high)
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
to

<p><tt><font size=-1>&nbsp; &nbsp; printMultiples(i, i)
<br></font></tt></p>

<p>
and you get

<p><tt><font size=-1>1
<br>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4
<br>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9
<br>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;16
<br>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25
<br>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;36
<br>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;21&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;28&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;35&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;42&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;49
<br></font></tt></p>

<h3>6.9 Functions</h3>
<p>
A few times now, we have mentioned "all the things functions are good
for."  By now, you might be wondering what exactly those things are.
Here are some of them:

<ul>
<li>Giving a name to a sequence of statements makes your program
easier to read and debug.</li>
<li>Dividing a long program into functions allows you to separate parts of
the program, debug them in isolation, and then compose them into a whole.</li>
<li>Functions facilitate both recursion and iteration.</li>
<li>Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs.  Once you
write and debug one, you can reuse it.</li>
</ul>

<dd>An invisible marker that keeps track of where the next
character will be printed.</dd>
<dt>escape sequence</dt>
<dd>An escape character (<tt>\</tt>) followed by one or
more printable characters used to designate a nonprintable character.</dd>
<dt>encapsulate</dt>
<dd>To divide a large complex program into components

using local variables, for example).</dd>
<dt>generalize</dt>
<dd>To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant

Generalization makes code more versatile, more likely to be reused, and
sometimes even easier to write.</dd>
<dt>development plan</dt>
<dd>A process for developing a program. In this chapter,
we demonstrated a style of development based on developing code to do
