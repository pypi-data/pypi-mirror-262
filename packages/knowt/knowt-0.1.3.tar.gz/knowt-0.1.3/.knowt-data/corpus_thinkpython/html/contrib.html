<h1>Contributor List</h1>
<p>
To paraphrase the philosophy of the Free Software Foundation, this
book is free like free speech, but not necessarily free like free
pizza.  It came about because of a collaboration that would not have
been possible without the GNU Free Documentation License.  So we
thank the Free Software Foundation for developing this license
and, of course, making it available to us.
<p>
We also thank the more than 100 sharp-eyed and
thoughtful readers who have sent us suggestions and corrections over
the past few years.  In the spirit of free software, we decided to
express our gratitude in the form of a contributor list.  Unfortunately,
this list is not complete, but we are doing our best to keep it
up to date.
<p>
If you have a chance to look through the list, you should
realize that each person here has spared you and all subsequent
readers from the confusion of a technical error or a
less-than-transparent explanation, just by sending us a note.
<p>
Impossible as it may seem after so many corrections, there may still
be errors in this book.  If you should stumble across one, please
check the online version of the book at <a href="http://thinkpython.com">http://thinkpython.com</a>,
which is the most up-to-date version.  If the error has not been
corrected, please take a minute to send us email at <a href="mailto:feedback@thinkpython.com">feedback@thinkpython.com</a>.  If we make a change due to your
suggestion, you will appear in the next version of the contributor
list (unless you ask to be omitted).  Thank you!
