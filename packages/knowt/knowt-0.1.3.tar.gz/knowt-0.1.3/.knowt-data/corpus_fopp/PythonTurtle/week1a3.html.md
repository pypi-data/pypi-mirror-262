-   [Tex.forward(20)]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_1_opt_a}
-   This is a correct way to move a turtle forward.
-   [forward() + 20]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_1_opt_b}
-   This does not use the turtle method necessary to move a turtle
    forward. Additionally, how would the program know what turtle should
    be moving?
-   [forward(20)]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_1_opt_c}
-   This does not use the turtle method necessary to move a turtle
    forward. Additionally, how would the program know what turtle should
    be moving?
-   [forward(20).Tex]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_1_opt_d}
-   This is not the correct structure to execute the task.
-   [Tex.forward(10 + 10)]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_1_opt_e}
-   You are allowed to write expressions inside of methods, so this is
    correctly written.
:::

::: {.runestone}
-   [turtle(Turtle)]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_2_opt_a}
-   When making a new instace of the turtle class, you need to use dot
    notation.
-   [turtle.Turtle()]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_2_opt_b}
-   Yes, this is the correct way.
-   [Turtle.turtle()]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_2_opt_c}
-   turtle represents the class and should be first.
-   [Turtle(turtle)]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_2_opt_d}
-   When making a new instace of the turtle class, you need to use dot
    notation.
:::

::: {.runestone}
-   [The turtle class.]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_3_opt_a}
-   Though each instance does use the turtle class, this is not the best
    answer.
-   [The same turtle that is used in each drawing your programs
    make.]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_3_opt_b}
-   Each instance that is made using the turtle class is unique.
    Remember how you can have multiple \'turtles\' in a single drawing?
    Each of those are different turtles but they are all instances of
    the turtle class.
-   [A unique \'turtle\' that you can use to
    draw.]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_3_opt_c}
-   Yes, an instance of the turtle class represents a unique turtle. The
    turtle class is like a stencil or mold that can be used to make as
    many turtles as you would like.

::: {.runestone}
-   [Change the value of an attribute.]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_5_opt_a}
-   Methods can change the value that is associated with an attribute.
-   [Return values.]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_5_opt_b}
-   Methods can return values.
-   [Create new attributes of an instance and set their
    values.]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_5_opt_c}
-   Attributes do not need to be pre-declared; any code can add a new
    attribute to an instance just by assigning a value to it.
-   [Delete object instances.]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_5_opt_d}
-   You do not explicitly delete object instances; when there are no
    variables or other references to them, so that they can\'t be
    accessed, they are automatically deleted.
-   [None of the above.]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_5_opt_e}
-   Methods can do at least one of the above. Take another look.
:::

::: {.runestone}
-   [student.title()]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_6_opt_a}
-   This accesses the attribute but then tries to invoke it as a method,
    which will fail if title is not a method.
-   [title.student()]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_6_opt_b}
-   student is the object, so it goes before the period; the attribute
    goes after.
-   [title.student]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_6_opt_c}
-   student is the object, so it goes before the period; the attribute
    goes after.
-   [student(title)]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_6_opt_d}
-   This would be the syntax for a function named student being called
    on a variable named title.
-   [student.title]{#assess_question1_3_1_1_6_opt_e}
-   Yes, this is the correct syntax to use.

Write a program that uses the turtle module to draw something. It
doesn't have to be complicated, but draw something different than we
have done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated,
it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting
`.speed(10)`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} for the turtle to draw
fast, or `.speed(0)`{.docutils .literal .notranslate} for it to draw
super fast with no animation.)
