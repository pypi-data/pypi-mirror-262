## hpr3840 :: Playing the Original Civilization

 This game is pretty old, but I found that wen I started a game
recently to prepare for this episode that it was still as addictive as
ever. I won't claim it is essential for everyone to run out and get it,
but if you did happen to find a copy somewhere and play it, you might
find you enjoy it. In this episode I give a few hints about getting
started with this game.
