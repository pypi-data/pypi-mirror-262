## hpr2394 :: The Lost Episode

 NYbill puts up a ‘Lost Episode’ recorded in October, 2016. A comment for Ep. 2369 asking if I have ever built one of the many Transistor Kits available jogged my memory. I still had the recording so, I’ll just throw it up. I’m not sure how many pics I can find for the episode. I’ll put up what I can.
And just for Mike Ray, I’ll leave in some bench noises I would usually edit out. ;)
The soldering vice being used:

The kit (This looks like the one I ordered. But, it's been about a year gone by now. This one shows firmware running on the chip in the pics. You can take a gamble on it if you’d like):
