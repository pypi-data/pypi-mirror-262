## hpr1195 :: Distractionless Writing

 ThistleWeb explains the advantages of a distractionless writing environment for fiction writers or aspiring fiction writers. A physical space of sanctuary is only the first part of the concept, but that's undone if your screen around your text is full of distractions. A distractionless writing application covers the entire screen, separating you from updates, notifications and editing options. ThistleWeb's distractionless environment of choice is Focuswriter, although there's quite a few to choose from.
