## hpr4025 :: Testing V language

 Pros

Strong static typing
compiles to C, no useless complexity like the JVM. Strong
foundation, C is here to stay and compiles to most obscure
architectures
small binary size
pattern matching and sum types
immutability by default
option/result types
compile time reflection
most Rust features, but memory management is automatic via GC or
-autofree. Really useful for GUI programs

Cons

still in beta
wants to be "clean", but they're adding too many features

database ORM into the language
GPU shaders
