## hpr1766 :: Sox of Silence

 
Many of you may be aware of the "truncate silence" filter in audacity. As I already use SOX to speed up my podcasts, I wanted to see if it could also remove silence as well. While the man page is detailed, it is difficult to follow. https://sox.sourceforge.net/


Fortunately Jason Navarrete posted an excellent article on digitalcardboard.com called The SoX of Silence which went through the process step by step https://digitalcardboard.com/blog/2009/08/25/the-sox-of-silence/

The Script

    # -S, --show-progress

    # remix Select and mix input audio channels into output audio channels. 
    # remix - performs a mix-down of all input channels to mono.
    # silence Removes silence from the beginning, middle, or end of the audio.
