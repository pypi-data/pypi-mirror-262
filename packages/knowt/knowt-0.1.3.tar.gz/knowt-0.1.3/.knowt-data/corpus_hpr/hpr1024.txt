## hpr1024 :: Episode 1024

 In the second and final installment of
Hacker Public Radio's first 1K episodes (yes Lord D, we know it's
really 1324 :) anniversary celebration, FiftyOneFifty hosts a panel
consisting of the following hosts from Today With a Techie and the
inaugural year of Hacker Public Radio: jrullo, klaatu, willjasen,
Lord Drachenblut, and Xoke (with Mrs. Xoke). Special thanks to
aparanoidshell, who stepped in to keep the conversation rolling when
FiftyOneFifty momentarily lost the connection.
