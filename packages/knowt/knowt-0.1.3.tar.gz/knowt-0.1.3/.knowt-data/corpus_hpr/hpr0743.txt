About BeagleBoard.org
BeagleBoard.org is an all volunteer activity started-up by a collection of passionate individuals, including several employees of Texas Instruments, interested in creating powerful, open, and embedded devices. We invite you to participate and become part of BeagleBoard.org, defining its direction.
Support for the Beagle Board comes from the very active development community through this website, the mailing list, and the IRC channel. Distribution is handled by Digi-Key, a major international distributor.
The Beagle Board is a low-cost, fan-less single-board computer based on low-power Texas Instruments processors featuring the ARM Cortex-A8 core with all of the expandability of today's desktop machines, but without the bulk, expense, or noise.
