BONUS EPISODE!


This episode was a bonus episode that I created just to work out the timing between seasons. We had completed the last season 3 at episode 156 (52 episodes * 3 years) but the first episode of season 4 (#157) was planned as a live event at hope NEXT week so I had a week gap with no show and I didn't want to ruin the live event, so I created this "half episode" to fill the slot this week..

This rare episode was streamed but was not on our archive. There may be a few copies floating around here or there, but this is the first official release of this episode on this site.
