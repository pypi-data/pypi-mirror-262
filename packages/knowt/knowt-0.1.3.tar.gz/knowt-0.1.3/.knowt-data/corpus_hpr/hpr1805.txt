## hpr1805 :: 56 - LibreOffice Impress - Styles and Objects 1 - Presentation Styles

 
We have previously looked at Styles for Writer, and for Calc, and now it is time to look at them for Impress. You may recall from both Writer and Calc that we saw it is important to know that Styles live inside of Templates. So any time you change a Style you needed to make sure it was saved inside of a Template, and if you wanted it to be generally available in all documents or spreadsheets you needed to be sure to make the change inside the Default Template.
