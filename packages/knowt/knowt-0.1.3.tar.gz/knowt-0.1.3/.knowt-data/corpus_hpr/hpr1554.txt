As usual, during this episode of the AudioBookClub the hosts have each reviewed a beverage of their choice.
Morgellon drank a Bourbon and soda, but not during the show because he was driving. He recommends both Woodford Reserve https://www.woodfordreserve.com/ and Evan Williams Bourbons https://www.evanwilliams.com/
x1101 drank Wild Turkey 101 proof Bourbon https://wildturkeybourbon.com/
pokey drank a cup of Oolong tea. It was probably a little stale, but pokey is a knuckle dragger, so he didn't notice at all. https://www.foojoyteas.com/teabag.php . This was the first time that pokey has reviewed an NA beverage for the AudioBookClub, so we apologize if the show has suffered because of it.
Thaj won the Non-Alcoholic division hands down with a glass of fresh squeezed lemonade.
Colin couldn't make it to this recording because of time zone differences, but he did write in. I'll add his note to the episode comments. Please add your own comment as well. His beverage however was an Innis and Gunn Original https://www.innisandgunn.com/the-range/core-range/original/ to which he gives his thumb up.


Our next audiobook will be How to Succeed in Evil: The Novel by Patrick E. McLean https://podiobooks.com/title/how-to-succeed-in-evil-the-novel/
(not to be confused with How To Succeed in Evil: The Original Podcast Episodes by Patrick E. McLean)
This book was suggested by Morgellon. Our next book club recording will be 2014/06/10T23:00:00+00:00 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Times)
