## hpr1038 :: Interview with George Vlahavas and Andreas Born of the Salix OS project

 
I've been using Salix OS, a Slackware derivative, for a while now and I wanted to share my love of it with it's developers and with all of you. If you find this interview or this GNU/Linux distro compelling please go to https://www.salixos.org and give it a try.


Thank you so much for listening.

P.S. Some people enjoy finding mistakes. For their enjoyment, I have probably included a few.
