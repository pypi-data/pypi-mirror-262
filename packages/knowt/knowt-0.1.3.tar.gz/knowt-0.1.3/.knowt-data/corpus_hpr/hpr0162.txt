What is webkit? 
It has a LGPL license 
Webkit is an open source application framework that provides 
a foundation upon which to build a web browser.
It was originally 
derived from the konqueror browser's khtml software library by Apple Inc. for use in Safari.
You can use Designer to create a nice gui and use the classes for QtWebKit inside it. 
Which means that you can drag and drop forms and create the gui real fast. 
The best part of QtWebKit is that you can pull stuff from the internet for you applications. 
In the article they created an app that will download the pdf files from past issues for you. With a nice search feature for their website. 

Examples of applications using Webkit: 
Adium 
Colloquy 
MSN Messenger 
Mac OS X's Dashboard 
The IPhone uses it as well
