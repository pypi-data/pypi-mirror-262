## hpr0718 :: How I got into Linux

 In his first podcast Brotherred talks about how he got into GNU/Linux after seeing a website powered by Linux in approx. 2001. 
Bought RedHat 9 with PC magazine. 
Not all Linux experience was rosy. 
Still loves GNU/Linux for playing games, download torrents, and audio/video editing.
