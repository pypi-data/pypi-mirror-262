## hpr1751 :: How I got into Linux

 
My third show, its my How I got into Linux show, Crunchbang for the win, thank you Corenominal. 


I actually wrote some of this up before I recorded my first show. I wasn't happy that I did a good enough job originally. However I decided to make use of a rainy day and get it updated and recorded.  I cut out a chunk of rambling about floppy drive cleaners, and stuck some more up to date info on the end.
