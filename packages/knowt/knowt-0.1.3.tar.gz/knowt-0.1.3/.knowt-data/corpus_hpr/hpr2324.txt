Overall the opensuse con 2017 was a great event.  Lots of talks, they had guy with 16 Raspberry PIs in a storage cluster and list goes on and on.  Many of the folks there were suse employees or Open Cloud employees but they really had their passions down.


Ubuntu 16.04 is running fine on my MS surface tablet and is wife friendly.
