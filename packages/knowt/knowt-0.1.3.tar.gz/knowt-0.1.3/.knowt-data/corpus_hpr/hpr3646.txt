my pi-top 3

came with experimentor kit, included a slide in solderless breadboard, and an rpi!
description
modifications

slackware install,lost some of the built in scripts that monitored the system, especially battery monitoring
added a daughter board with an atmega328 running forth to do the battery monitoring
added an rtc ds1307, installed via instructions from the sarpi website

pluses

better keyboard, with better mechanical design
better battery life, charging great
better screen

minuses

charging board seems closed source, that would be the keys to the kingdom
old software hard to come by
stuck in rpi3 form factor

plans

+upgrade to slackware 15-64 bit+
leave the rpi and go to a pineboard
reverse engineer charging board?
easier to modify case to accept new hardware
