## hpr1348 :: Fuse

 
A show about a 2nd world war fuse that had been in the family for many years, it originally belonged to my grandfather


Here is a link to the British Ordnance Collectors Network forums, which has a picture of a collection of German bomb fuses, the one my grandfather had looked identical to the one on the extreme left hand side of the picture entitled "25A".
