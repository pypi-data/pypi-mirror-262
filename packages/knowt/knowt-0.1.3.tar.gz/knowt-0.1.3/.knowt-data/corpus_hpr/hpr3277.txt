The following code snippet was edited for readability.
#Hold raspberrypi-sys-mods package
sudo apt-mark hold raspberrypi-sys-mods

#Redirect calls to packages.microsoft.com to localhost
sudo echo "0.0.0.0 packages.microsoft.com" >> /etc/hosts

#remove MS Key file
sudo rm -vf /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg

#create empty dummy key file
sudo touch /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg

#lock the dummy key file
sudo chattr +i /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg

#comment out vscode.list
sudo sed -i 's/deb/#deb/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list

#lock the vscode.list file
sudo chattr +i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list
