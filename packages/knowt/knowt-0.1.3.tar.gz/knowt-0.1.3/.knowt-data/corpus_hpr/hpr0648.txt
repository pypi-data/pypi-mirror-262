## hpr0648 :: Wput: a command-line ftp-client

 
Wput is a command-line ftp-client that looks like wget but instead of downloading, uploads files or whole directories to remote ftp-servers.

time-stamping (compares local and remote dates)
proxy-support (socks5, http)
i18n
windows-compatibility

Wput is a free utility that is able to upload files to a
ftp-server.

Wput is non−interactive and background-capable. It
can upload files or whole directories and is meant to be a
robust client even for unstable connections and will
therefore retry to upload a file, if the connection
broke.

Wput supports resuming, so it automatically continues
uploading from the point where the previous upload stopped,
meaning that you can kill Wput anytime and it will (if the
remote ftp−server supports this, being most likely the
case) finish the partial uploaded file.

Wput supports connections through proxies, allowing you
to use it in an environment that can access the internet
only via a proxy or to provide anonymity by hiding your
ip−address to the server. For SOCKSv5−proxies
Wput supports also listening mode, allowing you to use
port-mode ftp through a proxy (useful if the remote ftp is
behind a firewall or a gateway).

Wput supports timestamping, so it will (in the ideal case
and if timestamping is enabled) only upload files, that are
newer than the remote-file.

The upload-rate of Wput can be restricted, so that Wput
won’t eat all available bandwidth.
