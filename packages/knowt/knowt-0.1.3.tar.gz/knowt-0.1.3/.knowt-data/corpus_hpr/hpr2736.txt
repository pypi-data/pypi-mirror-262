## hpr2736 :: Response to show 2720

 Introduction
On January 4th 2019 Ken Fallon did a great show entitled hpr2720 :: Download youtube channels using the rss feeds where he presented a Bash script called youtube-rss.bash for managing YouTube downloads through RSS feeds.
Ken said he welcomed constructive feedback ☺
When I see a Bash script these days I usually find myself looking for ways to rewrite it to make it fit in with what I have been learning while doing my Bash Tips sub-series. Either that or I find it’s got some better ideas than I’ve been using which I have to find out about.
I also spend time going over my own old scripts (I was writing them in the 1990’s in some cases) and trying to incorporate newer Bash features.
Suffice it to say that I spotted some areas for improvement in Ken’s script and thought this might be the way to share my thoughts about them. We’re low on shows as I write this, so that gave me more motivation to make a show rather than add a comment or send Ken an email.
Apology: I’m still suffering from the aftermath of some flu-like illness so have had to edit coughing fits out of the audio at various points. If you detect any remnants then I’m sorry!
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
