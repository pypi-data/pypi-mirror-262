English Translation
We're back with a more regular type of episode for episode 10, and we start off with a gem of a thing; a Javascript version of Tron in a ridiculously small number of lines of code. Next up, we say strewth to the Aussie bobbies who are now roaming the streets for open wifi networks to scare folks into closing them.
You can't say we're not doing our public doody, we put the call out for the poor truck driver who lost his job due to them thieving bastards, the interwebs pirates. Then we note that it's the same old same old at Microsoft, with the EU staff being urged to refuse bribes in the form of Windows and Office licenses. Finally we note that despite Mozilla flying the flag for user privacy, why would any companies respect the "do not track" option?
In our discussion this week, we focussed on the plight of Game; the video game specialist chain in the UK who went into administration this week, where they went wrong, and if it's inevitable and just a sign of the times.
