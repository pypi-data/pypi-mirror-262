## hpr2472 :: Forum Failure

 In 2017 I created a forum over at Proboards dedicated to my audio work and writing. It didn't attract a user base, and I deleted it when 2018 rolled around.
These are just some thoughts about why I wanted it to begin with, and why I think it failed.
I still believe Proboards is a good way to jump into forums and using forum software, and still recommend it for that reason:
