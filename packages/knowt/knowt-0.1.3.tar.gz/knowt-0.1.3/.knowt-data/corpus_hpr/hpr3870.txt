## hpr3870 :: Texas

 Our stay in Presidio was a nice one, and we enjoyed the companionship
at the RV park. This gave us access to the Big Bend Ranch State Park,
and we had a few good outings there. But we wanted to visit the Big Bend
National Park, which was not as reachable as we would like, so we booked
a few days in Alpine, Texas. This turned out to be fortuitous for an
important repair. And after seeing the National Park it was time to head
back to Michigan. We had a long but very nice trip, but as always at the
end of a trip we look forward to being back in our home and sleeping in
our bed.
