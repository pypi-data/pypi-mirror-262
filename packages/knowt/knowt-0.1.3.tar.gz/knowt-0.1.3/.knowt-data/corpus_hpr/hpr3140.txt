## hpr3140 :: GIMP: Selection Tools

 Selection Tools define the area that other tools will work within. For example, if you want to add color to an image, you probably want to add it to a specific area, not to the entire image. Selection Tools help you to pick the area precisely, and are useful for photo retouching purposes.
