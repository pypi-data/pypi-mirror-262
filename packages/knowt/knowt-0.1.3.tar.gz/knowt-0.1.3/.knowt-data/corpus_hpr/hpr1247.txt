## hpr1247 :: Recording Terrestrial Radio with bash scripts and cron jobs

 In this episode I talk about my solution for capturing terrestrial 
radio so that I can listen to it at my own convenience. I use a bash 
script, cron jobs, and the streamripper package. here are some links 
to things I mentioned in the podcast.
