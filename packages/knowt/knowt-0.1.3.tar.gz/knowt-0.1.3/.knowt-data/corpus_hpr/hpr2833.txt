 In this show an Interview with Joep Piscaer, recorded during the recent Loadays conference in Antwerpen, Belgium.
Schedule of recent Loadays event: https://cfp.loadays.org/2019/schedule/
I mention the "Cut the crap podcast", made by Ryan Caligiuri.
And specifically episode 145 as an excellent example of his podcast quality:
