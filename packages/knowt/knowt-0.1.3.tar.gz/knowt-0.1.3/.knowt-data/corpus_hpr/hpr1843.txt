## hpr1843 :: Some Bash tips

 Today I want to talk about three Bash commands:

pushd
popd
dirs

These let you change directory on a Linux system (and others which support Bash) but keep a record of where you have been in a stack structure. The stack can be viewed and manipulated with these commands as well.
I have written out a moderately long set of notes about these commands and these are available here https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1843_full_shownotes.html.
