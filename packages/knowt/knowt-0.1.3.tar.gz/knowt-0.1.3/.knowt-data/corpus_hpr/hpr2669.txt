 Additional ancillary Bash tips - 12
Making decisions in Bash
This is the twelfth episode in the Bash Tips sub-series. It is the fourth of a group of shows about making decisions in Bash.
In the last three episodes we saw the types of test Bash provides, and we looked briefly at some of the commands that use these tests. We looked at conditional expressions and all of the operators Bash provides to do this. We concentrated particularly on string comparisons which use glob and extended glob patterns.
Now we want to look at the other form of string comparison, using regular expressions.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
