## hpr3032 :: piCore on a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B

 In this episode, I discuss how I revived my Raspberry Pi 1 Model B using piCore, a specialized version of Tiny Core Linux for the Raspberry Pi, on a 128 MB SD card that I had laying around. I also mention nanoBSD and Alpine Linux as possible alternatives to try out.
