## hpr0771 :: Mischief Managed

 With Customs in various countries acting as Copyright Cops, using any excuse to rifle through your personal and private data not only for threats, but copyright infringement. Wouldn't it be great to have invisible ink? You can get your private data through Customs, under the scrutiny of the Copyright Cops while also being a fully cooperative model citizen.
ThistleWeb discusses three ways to do this with the drawbacks of each.

Using a Cloud service of some sort to store your data on as you travel, where you upload then download after going through Customs.
Using a decoy user account on your regular installed distro
Using a decoy distro as a dual boot

Harry Potter got the Marauders Map in book three, which transforms to blank parchment with a tap of the wand the words "mischief managed" so nobody knows it's a dynamic map of Hogwarts and it's inhabitants. Now your laptop or netbook can have the same invisible ink qualities.
So repeat after me "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!"
Just like the GPL, use at your own risk.
