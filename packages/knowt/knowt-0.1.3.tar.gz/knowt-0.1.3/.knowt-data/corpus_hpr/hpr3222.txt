## hpr3222 :: Musings about writing a book about the Odoo software suite

 In this podcast I describe how I met another Dutch guy at the Ubucon 2018 conference in Spain. And how he asked me to write another book, this time about Odoo. How I learned how the Odoo ecosystem works, with the Odoo S.A. company and the Odoo Community Association (OCA).
At the end I had a finished book.
You can find the book here: https://www.lulu.com/en/en/shop/jeroen-baten/jumpstart-your-business-with-odoo-12-ennl/paperback/product-1wkzmj52.html

Warm regards, Jeroen Baten
