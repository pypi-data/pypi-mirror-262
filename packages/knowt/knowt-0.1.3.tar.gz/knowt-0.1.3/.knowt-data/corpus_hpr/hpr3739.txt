## hpr3739 :: Multipactors for the masses.

 I found an copy of an old video. This episode is just a verbal
transcription of that lecture.

Electrostatic containment.
Fusor.
Riggatron.
Multipactor.

Robert Murray Smith has got some thoroughly practical and useful
instructional material on Youtube. His channel is his name. He is keen
to transmit knowledge and to stimulate innovation.
I just looked up the books which he has written, and one of them is
on the subject of this episode:
Beyond The Fusor: A New Design For A Table Top Fusion Reactor And
How To Build It
by Robert Murray-Smith.
