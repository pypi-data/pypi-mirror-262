## hpr2884 :: TASCAM Porta 02 MiniStudio 4-Track Cassette Recorder Demonstration

 I discuss and demonstrate the latest retro gadget I found at the flea market last weekend, a TASCAM Porta 02 MiniStudio 4-Track Cassette Recorder. It was in a bin full of junk—filthy, lacking its power supply, and I got it for only $5. I hacked a power supply, disassembled it completely, washed everything thoroughly, and put it back together. It worked perfectly with the exception of the pause button. This has been one of the most fun projects I can remember, especially because my daughter is into it too, and she's learning how to make multi-track recordings. I always wanted a 4-track when I was in high school but never had one. Now I do!
