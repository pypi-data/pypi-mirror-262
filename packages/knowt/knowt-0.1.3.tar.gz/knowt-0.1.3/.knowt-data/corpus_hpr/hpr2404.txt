Meridian 59
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Meridian 59 is known as the first 3D graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) and stands as one of the longest running original online role-playing games. Developed by Archetype Interactive, the team included John Hanke who later founded Niantic, Inc. and codeveloped Google Earth and Pok√©mon Go.
First published by the now defunct 3DO Company, the game was first launched online in an early form on December 15, 1995 and released commercially on September 27, 1996 with a flat-rate monthly subscription. Meridian 59 is currently available as open source software and is being run by original developers Andrew Kirmse and Chris Kirmse.
