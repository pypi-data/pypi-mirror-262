 Making a Raspberry Pi inventory
Introduction
I have a number of Raspberry Pis -- possibly too many -- and I sometimes lose track of which is which, what model, size, name, address each one is. I wanted to be able to keep an inventory of them all, and to this end I wrote myself a little script that can be run on any Pi which will report useful information about it.
Every Pi has a unique serial number. Actually it's randomly generated so there may be a few collisions but it's close to unique! It also contains a revision number which encodes various items of information about it such as release date, model, PCB revision and memory. My script decodes this revision number for you based on a published table.
I run a Wikimedia instance on a Pi and have used this script to record details of my Pis there as well as what they are being used for and any planned projects. I now feel more organised!
Long notes
