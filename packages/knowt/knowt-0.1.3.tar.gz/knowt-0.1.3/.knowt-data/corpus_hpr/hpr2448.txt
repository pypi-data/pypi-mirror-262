 Useful Bash functions - part 3
Overview
This is the third show about Bash functions. These are a little more advanced than in the earlier shows, and I thought I'd share them in case they are useful to anyone.
As before it would be interesting to receive feedback on these functions and would be great if other Bash users contributed ideas of their own.
Full Notes
Since the notes explaining this subject are long, they have been placed here.
