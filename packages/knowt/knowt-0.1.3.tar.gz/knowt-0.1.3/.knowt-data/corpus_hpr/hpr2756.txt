## hpr2756 :: Bash Tips - 20

 Tidying loose ends (Some collateral Bash tips)
Deleting arrays
I forgot to cover one thing on my list when doing the last show: I forgot to explain how to delete arrays and array elements. I’ll cover that topic in this episode.
Positional and Special parameters
I have also avoided talking much about the positional and special parameters in Bash: '$1', '$2', '$#' and the rest. I will cover (some of) these in this episode.
Silly titles
I stopped doing the weird episode titles by episode 14 because I thought the joke was getting tired. However, I think a few people missed them (and a certain HPR colleague was found vandalising my new titles as they were being posted ;-), so I have added them inside the notes on the older shows and am adding one here – as a homage to silliness.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
