There are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics
In today's show we discover that Hacker Public Radio is not a Podcast Hosting Platform.
Each day your show will be heard by as many people as can squeeze into the main auditorium at FOSDEM, or between two and three Airbus A380-800. You know the big double decker passenger plane. Every month we have on average 33,584 downloads, that's about 40 fully loaded Airbus A380-800.

Podcast "Hosting" Sites, like Spotify, Apple Podcast or Google Podcasts, etc. do not host the media, they are essentially monetizing Hacker Public Radio content. And we are all absolutely fine with that because our shows are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.

Every one of those dots is a download that is not without cost, but is provided entirely free of charge to us by our kind hosting Provider AnHonestHost.com and the volunteer project the Internet Archive. Both of which donates terabytes of storage and data transfer to us for free.
The people to thank are our own Josh Knapp over at AnHonestHost.com, who provides the Hacker Public Radio web site.
And the Internet Archive which is an American digital library with the stated mission of "universal access to all knowledge", who provide hosting for the media.
