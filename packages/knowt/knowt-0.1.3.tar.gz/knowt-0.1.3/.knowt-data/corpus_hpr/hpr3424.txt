Part 6 - Infosec Leadership


Preamble
Term: CISO

Pronounced SEE-so or SAI-so
Chief Information Security Officer
Sounds like executive leadership position, similar to Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), etc but this is often not the case

Security leadership is changing
Old way:

Experienced technologists (Usually old white guys) worked way up ranks
Usually reported through IT (CIO/CTO)
Department of "No" - Block everything bad
Slows down business

New way:

Experienced business professionals with leadership skills and security understanding
Can report through:

IT (CIO/CTO)
Legal (For compliance reasons)
Finance (CFO) for governance or compliance reasons
Financial impacts of attacks
Direct costs
Fines
CEO - Seat at the table with other C-level execs
Direct to board

Empowers the business to succeed in a secure way
Can still slow down the business, but only when needed
