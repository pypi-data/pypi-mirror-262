## hpr3327 :: Looking into Ceph storage solution

 We look into what a Ceph implementation entails, what specific use-cases it excels at.
And we also talk about the building blocks of the system. What kind of hosts is required for different Ceph daemons and the requirements regarding disk space, CPU, and memory.
The services we are talking about are OSD (Object storage daemon), Monitors, Managers, and MDS (MetaData Services).
Ceph can be used as an S3 compatible object store, disk storage, and even a file system, depending on your setup.
If you are interested in diving deeper into the topic, I have created a couple of videos on the subject that might interest you.
