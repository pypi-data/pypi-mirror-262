Instructions

Find a show in the list below
Check in the list which attributes are missing: summary and/or tags
Click the show number or title to visit the show page
Read the show notes and listen to the show to determine the missing information
Submit your updates by email to tags at hackerpublicradio.org

Please send simple ASCII email. No HTML please, and no multipart, encrypted or signed messages; the script can't handle them at the moment! (We are working on a solution to some of this though). Remember, the internals of an email are complex and the script isn't clever enough to deal with all the many possible formats. Please be gentle with it!
Format the message as follows:
show:12345
summary:Using Linux at Christmas to make tomato soup in a sporran
tags:linux,christmas,sporran,tomato soup

show: 12346
tags: sausage,clothing,hairpiece

Start with the show:XXXX line (just the show number, no 'hpr')
If either the summary or the tags are already present on the show you can omit them from the group
It's not possible to change existing summaries or tags by this route, only to add missing ones
Ensure the summary text isn't longer than 100 characters
The tags need to be separated by commas
If you need to add a tag with a comma in it enclose the tag in double quotes
The length of the tag list can't exceed 200 characters
You can update more than one show per email if you want
Blank lines between the groups of show/summary/tags lines are fine (as shown), as are comment lines beginning with '#'

Updates will be processed with a script, which is run manually, and this page will be refreshed once the changes have been made. The timestamp above shows when it was last refreshed.

Got carried away and broke the 100 character rule

can be checked in vim by hitting '$', goes to the last character in the line. Observe the character count at the bottom of the screen to verify this is less than 100.

Went a little too far with tags, and went pretty far beyond the 200 character
Found that these are reasonable limits, that if not followed, break the script
Don't be like me. Gently use these tools and they will serve you well.
Here are some of the tools I used when tagging was done right.

i3 window manager

Use mplayer and vim

Mplayer

Play audio file faster without pitch increase
https://kenfallon.com/speeding-up-speech-with-mplayer
{ key will slow down by 50% of the current rate
[ key will slow down by 10% of the current rate
Backspace will return the speed to normal
] key will speed up 10% of the current rate
} key will speed up by 50% of the current rate
9 key will decrease the volume
0 key will increase the volume

alias mplayer='mplayer -af scaletempo'

Android - Termux

Download a show via wget (Doing this on Firefox does not show progress bar)

PodcastAddict

advantage is having timestamps where you tagged (for reference)
