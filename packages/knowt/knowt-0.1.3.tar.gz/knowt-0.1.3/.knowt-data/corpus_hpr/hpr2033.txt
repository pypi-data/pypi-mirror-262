## hpr2033 :: Distro Review: Bodhi Linux

 
As with my last episode, you may hear some sniffling or pauses as I catch my breath. It is springtime in Kentucky, and my allergies are full force right now.
In this episode, I take Bodhi Linux for a test drive. I'll tell you what I liked, what I didn't like, and how well or bad it performed on my test machine.
