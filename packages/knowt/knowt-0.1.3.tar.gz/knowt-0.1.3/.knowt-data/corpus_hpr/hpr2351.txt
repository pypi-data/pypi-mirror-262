Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available in the archives run
externally by Gmane
(see below) and on the HPR server under Mailman.

Note: since the summer of 2016 Gmane has changed location and is currently
being reestablished. At the moment the HPR archive is not available there.
The threaded discussions this month can be found here:

Tags and Summaries
In the past month we have had contributions from 
	    bjb and
	    Windigo 
	    and I have added a few tags & summaries myself. Many thanks to
	    all contributors.
See the current status and instructions for making your own
	    contribution at "Shows without a summary and/or tags".
	    This page has recently been reformatted for easier navigation and
	    a new section has been added. This section lists the hosts whose
	    shows need attention followed by the show numbers that need work.
Currently there are 957 shows which need summaries or tags to be
	    added. All contributions to this project are most welcome.
