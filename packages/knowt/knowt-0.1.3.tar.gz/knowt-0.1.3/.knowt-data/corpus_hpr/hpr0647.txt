## hpr0647 :: How I Got Into Linux

 Linux-specific content starts at the 15min mark.  Until then is all the
computer geekery that led up to my first linux exposure.  Feel free
to skip forward if you don't want to hear about old systems like the
Commodores, TI, 5.25" floppies, FidoNet BBS, etc.

Clarifications and corrections:
The Apple ][e setup I describe was almost exactly $2000.
I still own the TI 99/4A and BASIC manual;  I cranked it
up a few years ago.  The thing that sticks out is how terrible
the keyboard is -- it's almost unusable but seemed fine at the
time..
