What is PhreakNIC?PhreakNIC is Nashville's annual hacker con. Anyone is welcome to attend. We create an environment where people who are interested in the more underground elements of technology can meet, exchange ideas and hopefully teach/learn. The primary focus is on computers and computer security, but we also cover other topics, such as radio (ham, pirate & low-power/community), SETI work, robotics, high-power rocketry, satellites, phones and phreaking, cryptography, etc. PhreakNIC is organized annually by Nashville 2600 a non-profit organization.
Pre-Registration is available again through click and pledge at store.phreaknic.info. If you pre-register this year please use the "Customize your con badge" link in the menu to submit your visage/logo for your badge. This will be our fifteenth year and we hope you will make plans to join us.
Who is PhreakNIC
PhreakNIC is attended by anyone with a curious mind.  That being said we are now accepting papers for this year.  If you would like to give a talk submit your name and a brief synopsis of what you'd like to talk about to president -at- nashville2600.org.
