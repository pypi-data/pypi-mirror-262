## hpr1673 :: How I use ZFS on Linux

 
On the show today, I will tell you about how I use the ZFS file system on my home server. I also go into some details about how I came to use the ZFS, especially under Linux. I also tell you about a certain pitfall I ran into with the hard drives I chose for ZFS. And finally, I will refer you back to HPR episode 1600 by JWP for more information about ZFS, as he goes into great detail about it and its history.
