 As part of Hacker Public Radio's continuing effort to showcase Creative Commons Works, we are proud to present GeekSpeak. GeekSpeak is produced as a radio show for community based station KUSP in Monterey CA, and rebroadcast as podcast, available from GeekSpeak.org. It is a generally a lighthearted and humorous general technology news show, with topics including electronics, computing, robotics, and green tech. Often guest speakers and authors from the technology world will come on for interviews. The shows are just about an hour long.
The regular hosts are Bonnie Jean Primbsch, Lyle Troxell, Miles Elam, and Ben Jaffe (see GeekSpeak.org/geeks/for the full roster). You can often hear them thanking the "Puppetmaster" for letting them continue to use the name GeekSpeak. After broadcasting for several years, it was discovered the term "GeekSpeak" had been registered as a service mark by David Lawrence for a podcast of his own. You might remember Lawrence as the actor who played the character on "Heroes" with the telekinetic ability to physically manipulate other characters against their will.
GeekSpeak has a long standing tradition of using Devo's "Through Bein' Cool" as intro music, so only those episodes that employ user contributed music instead are actually released Creative Commons. What you are about to hear, from the 1st of June of 2013, is just such an episode.

https://7thavenueproject.com/ - This is another KUSP show, often dealing with sciencetific topics. I mention it here, because I originally wanted feature a GeekSpeak that I had found fascinating, even though it featured none of the regular hosts : https://geekspeak.org/shows/audio/GeekSpeak_2012-11-24.mp3?1354389765 "Hany Farid, Digital Image Detective with Robert Pollie of The 7th Avenue Project" Basically, Farid talked about the methods he uses to determine whether a digital image has been altered. Ultimately, since it was a re-broadcast of an earlier "7th Avenue Project", and not knowing the original licensing, I decided to bring you a more traditional and recent sample of GeekSpeak.
