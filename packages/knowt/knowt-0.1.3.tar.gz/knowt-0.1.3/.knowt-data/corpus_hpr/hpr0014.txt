## hpr0014 :: Databases 101 Part 2

 RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
Relational Model: when there are relationships between items of
data such as products, customers and orders
A database contains two-dimensional tables which are similar in
concept to spreadsheets. Each table contains columns and rows like
a spreadsheet, but these are called fields and records in
database terminology
Data is stored in tables but is broken down into the most efficient form
such that there is no duplication. This process is called
normalisation.
Fields have data types associated with them, such as numeric fields for
storing numbers or text fields for storing text.
Tables have keys to simplify searching. Primary keys are
used to make records in a table unique.
