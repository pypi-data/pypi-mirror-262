## hpr2417 :: Transmeta Crusoe - Fujitsu-Siemens Futro S210 (ThinClient) - Trouble Shooting and Debian 9 Install

 I did the long awaited basement clean up project.
lots of old geeky stuff went to the bins and recycle yards :(
The Transmeta company made chips around 2000 and made chip x86 ready though a software layer. Since I love almost anything that is not Intel it was a match made in heaven.
The best info I found about the FSI 210 was at this site:
Fujitsu-Siemens Futro S210 (ThinClient)
If you want to do a project at raspberry PI prices just go to Ebay and type Futro - they have a lot of Thin clients with other chips.
