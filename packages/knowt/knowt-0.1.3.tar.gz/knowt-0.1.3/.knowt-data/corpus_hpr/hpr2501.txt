Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:

Tags and Summaries
Thanks to Windigo and bjb for sending in updates in the past month.
Over the period 25 shows have had tags and/or summaries added.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
This page has been extended this month by the addition of a list of tags at the end. Each tag is followed by the show numbers which use that tag, each being a link to the show.
The thinking is that if you are considering which tags to add to a show without them you can look through this list to find out whether other people have used the tag and in what context.
