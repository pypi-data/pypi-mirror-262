## hpr3939 :: How I got into tech and hacking

 In the show, I mention that leaving Mark Williams Company was "a
story for another time", but the short answer is that Linux crushed
them. Coherent Unix had to make a choice to compete with either Windows,
SCO Unix, or Linux, and had enough budget to add either X Windows or
TCP/IP networking. They chose X11, and IMO that killed any chance of
Coherent Unix being useful in a world of Linux and FreeBSD.
