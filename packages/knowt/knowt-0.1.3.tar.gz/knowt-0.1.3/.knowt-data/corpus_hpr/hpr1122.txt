The ln command is used to create a link between an existing file and a destination, typically newly created, file. Some operating systems may all this creating a short-cut. Recall that Linux treats everything like a file, thus you can create links to files, directories, or even devices.

There are two types of links:

Hard Links: A hard like is a connection where two files share the same inode.
Symbolic Links: A symbolic link is a special file that refers to a different file.
