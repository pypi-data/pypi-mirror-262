## hpr0006 :: Part 15 Broadcasting

 dosman and zach from the packetsniffers talk about Part 15 Broadcasting which is low power broadcasting for the local area. Used to do community radio around an event, a church, concerts etc. They discuss what the regulations are in the US, what you need, how to get started, what things to consider. All in all great introduction to the topic.
