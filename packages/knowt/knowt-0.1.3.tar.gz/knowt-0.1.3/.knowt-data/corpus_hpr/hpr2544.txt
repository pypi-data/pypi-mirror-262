 How I prepared episode 2493: YouTube Subscriptions - update
Introduction
In show 2493 I listed a number of the YouTube channels I watch. Some of what I did to prepare the notes was to cut and paste information from YouTube pages, but the basic list itself was generated programmatically. I thought the process I used might be of interest to somebody so I am describing it here.
Components
I needed four components to achieve what I wanted:

YouTube subscription list (only available in OPML format as far as I know)
The xmlstarlet tool to parse the OPML
Template Toolkit which I used to generate Markdown
The pandoc document converter tool to generate HTML

I will talk a little about the first three components in this episode in order to provide an overview.
Full-length notes
The full-length notes (available here) contain details of the processes involved in building the list of channels.
