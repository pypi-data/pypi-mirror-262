Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2022-August/thread.html

Git repository for HPR development
For security reasons the Gitea service running on https://repo.anhonesthost.net requires people to log in with an account to view the repositories.
Is this acceptable or do we need to move the code to another location?
