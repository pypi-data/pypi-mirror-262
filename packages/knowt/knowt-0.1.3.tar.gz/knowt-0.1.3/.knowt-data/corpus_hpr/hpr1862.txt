## hpr1862 :: The Awesomely Epic Guide To KDE Part 1

 
Hello my name is Geddes and this is my first HPR Episode. Its part 1 of an audio voice recording of an  article entitled THE AWESOMELY EPIC GUIDE TO KDE. This is a tutorial on the KDE Desktop,  which I did for Linux Voice Magazine back at the start of 2015. Its primarily in response to the call from HPR for more shows, but in my introduction I've also mentioned a few other reasons which I hope listeners will find interesting, a couple are around the issues of diversity and accessibility.
