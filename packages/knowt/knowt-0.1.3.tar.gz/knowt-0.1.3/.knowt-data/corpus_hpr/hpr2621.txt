## hpr2621 :: Liverpool Makefest 2018 - Chan'nel Thomas a.k.a little pink maker

 In this episode recorded at Liverpool Makefest 2018 I talk to Chan'nel Thomas aka little pink maker. Chan'nel has an amazing web site; the link is below. I was going to include a couple of pictures taken on the day but they don't do her work the justice it deserves.
