## hpr1459 :: Locational Privacy with retrotech-the lowly pager

 
In this episode, deepgeek suggests that adding and old, and perhaps laughable
by modern standards, device to your mobile lifestyle.  Deepgeek reveals that
said device is the pager, but he eventually gives good reasons for doing so.


The primary reason is that the paging company does not know where you are, 
so they can't tell "the man" where you are.  Other reasons are redundancy 
and trouble interpreting audio.  But in the end, you find out why first 
responders and medical and fire personal still use these devices, and how you, 
as a privacy lover, may reap benefits from using this technology also.
