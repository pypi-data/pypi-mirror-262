## hpr3679 :: Linux Inlaws S01E64: Non-profits in the US: A closer look at 501(c)s

 In this episode, Martin and Chris shed more light on the riveting subject of non-profit
and not-for-profit organisations especially in the US with a special focus on the all-
important topic of tax implications. Warning: Due to the fast-paced and gripping never
mind explicit nature of this topic, people with sleeping disabilities or who are easily startled
/ offended by graphic content should consult a member of the medical profession to ensure
that they are capable of handling this episode. You have been warned.
