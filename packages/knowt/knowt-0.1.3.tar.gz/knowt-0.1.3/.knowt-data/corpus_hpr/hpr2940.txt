## hpr2940 :: Better Social Media 05 - Mastodon

 As mentioned earlier, Diaspora was one of the earliest alternative, privacy-respecting social media platforms, but it was focused on being an alternative to Facebook (and it has done this fairly well). But that leaves the other big platform of the social world, Twitter. Mastodon is a nice federated alternative to Twitter and a nicer place to be. https://www.zwilnik.com/?page_id=1034
