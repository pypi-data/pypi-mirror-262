## hpr0140 :: LPI Certification Part 6 Device Configuration

 Objective:

Candidates should be able to install and configure internal and external communication
devices such as modems, ISDN adapters, and DSL switches. This objective includes
verification of compatibility requirements (especially important if that modem is a
winmodem), necessary hardware settings for internal devices (IRQs, DMAs, I/O ports), and
loading and configuring suitable device drivers. It also includes communication device and
interface configuration requirements, such as the correct serial port for 115.2 Kbps, and the
correct modem settings for outbound PPP connection(s).

Key files, terms, and utilities include:

/proc/dma          Direct memory accessing channels in use
/proc/interrupts   Interrupts in use
/proc/ioports      I/O ports in use
setserial(8)       Configure serial port access for an internal modem
