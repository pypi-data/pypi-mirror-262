Apologies to speed listeners. I just couldn't make this episode speed-listener-friendly.
This episode was made out of respect and admiration for the HPR contributers mentioned throughout the show.
Disclaimer:
I barely have a clue of what I am doing. And there are mistakes all over the place in this episode. It's just something I wanted to through out there to change things up a little, and pay homage to those I admire, and with a little luck, inspire others to use their creativity to record an episode of their own.
You can do better. And I want to hear what you have to offer.
The meegopad T-02 turned out to be something I wouldn't recommend to others, and the follow-up episode to this one will be a walk through of what it takes to "hack" the T-02 into being something that is usable.
Depending on the feedback to this episode, I can either follow the theme I started with this show, or do a more traditional HPR episode with a no frills walk through of the process of hacking the T-02 to work as advertised. So let me know what you prefer.
Apologies to listeners from outside North America. The many slang terms used throughout the episode are representative of the hard boiled genre of noir to give this episode a certain "feel".
