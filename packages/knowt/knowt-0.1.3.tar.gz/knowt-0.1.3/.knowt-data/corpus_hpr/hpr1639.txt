## hpr1639 :: Ken Starks at Ohio Linux Fest 2014

 Ken Starks gave the closing keynote at Ohio LinuxFest 2014 on 10/25/14. In this talk he discusses his work with the REGLUE project (formerly the Helios Project) which bulds computers to give to disadvantaged kids in Texas. And if you look there may be something like this in your town that you can help with. And if not, why not start one? This talk was recorded by Randy Noseworthy, and he asked me to post it to HPR.
