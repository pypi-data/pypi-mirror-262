## hpr2657 :: Why we are all going to shit in 30 years due to computers

 Now, this is not a doom and gloom lecture.
Actually it is a talk about what is going to happen in the next 30 years.
It is a talk about what is called “postcapitalism”.

It talks about the three big challenges we need to face.
And yes, this involves you as well!
