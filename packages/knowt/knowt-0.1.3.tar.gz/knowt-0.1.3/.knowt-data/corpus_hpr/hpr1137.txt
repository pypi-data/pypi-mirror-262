This Beginners' guide will show you how to add data to
OpenStreetMap. Tutorials are available in many languages which you
can select from the table at the top of this page. 

You need a computer connected to the Internet and some time to
gather information and then enter it. A GPS unit and connecting cable
are purely optional, but will be required if you want to collect data
that way. Given the excellent aerial photography available in the
editors these days a GPS is less important than in the early days of
the project.

        tutorials. 
        

The data you add to OpenStreetMap improves the free world map for
everyone, whether it's a small correction or thousands of roads added
over time. Thank you for making OpenStreetMap just that bit better! 

There is a panel on the right of every page of the tutorial. The
page you are on will be in bold text and you can move to any other
page by clicking on the relevant page title. The bottom of each page
has 'next' and 'previous' links, as appropriate, to take you through
the tutorial page by page.
