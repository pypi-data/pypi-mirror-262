## hpr1789 :: The Ubuntu Quickly Ebook Template and Ebooks in General

 Ubuntu Quickly Ebook Template
I recorded this conversation with Mike Hingley about a year ago (12 June 2014) but never released it because I thought the audio didn't sound very good and I didn't feel like editing it at the time. Honestly I forgot all about it until now when the HPR queue is low again. I apologize for the slightly clippy quality of my audio, I must have had my microphone too hot on the mumble. It's really interesting to listen to this conversation a year later because I have worked out so many of the problems that I was mentioning to Mike, including the automation of the entire build process using command-line tools from Calibre.
