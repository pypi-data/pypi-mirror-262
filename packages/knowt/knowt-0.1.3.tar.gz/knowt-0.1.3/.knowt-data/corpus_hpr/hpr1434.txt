## hpr1434 :: Why I made an account free android 

 
Why I built an Account Free Google tablet. Including links of what was done. Some basic criteria. No accounts created for downloading, installing or configuring except for mail accounts. No rooting. No pirated apps. Something that can be easy for a user to do including installing and updating apps. One ad supported app installed, but hope to find an alternative.
