## hpr3400 :: Normal Layer Modes: Normal, Dissolve, Color Erase

 Layer Modes, sometimes called Blending Modes, allow you to combine layers in a variety of ways. We'll begin with the Normal modes and work our way through many, but not all, of the Layer Modes available on the latest (at the time I write this) version of GIMP, 2.10.20.
