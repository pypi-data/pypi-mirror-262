## hpr3100 :: For your consideration - Makers Corner

 
I'm amazed I didn't find this podcast earlier, epically as one half of the team is HPR Host Yannick, and that we listed it on our Sister Project Free Culture Podcasts.

This show is a sample episode I picked, but it is not a typical show. I wanted to give a bit more exposure to the interview.


In this episode, Nate talks about his oldest boy’s Electronic Engineering class. Then, Jon and Phil join in to talk about the 32Blit. And finally, the guys have a look at the Monster Mouth Headphone Holder – Clampable, from thingiverse.
