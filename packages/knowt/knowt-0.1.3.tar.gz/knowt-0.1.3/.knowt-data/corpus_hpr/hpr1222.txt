## hpr1222 :: LiTS 027: mathematical commands

 
Episode 27 of Linux in the Shell continues on with looking at some mathematical commands. Four programs are discussed:


factor - which will give you the prime factors of a number

primes - which will list all the prime numbers between a start and option stopping number

seq - sequence will list all the numbers given a stopping point or a starting and stopping point. You can also specify an increment or decrement value.

arithmetic - Arithmetic is a game from the bsd games package that will quiz you on arithmetic problems.
