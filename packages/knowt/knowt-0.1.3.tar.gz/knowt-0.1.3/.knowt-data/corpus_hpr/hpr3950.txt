## hpr3950 :: Sid Meiers' Alpha Centauri

 Because it doesn't have the word "Civilization" in its name, this
game is unfairly overlooked. It was a major achievement when released,
and it is still a very rewarding game for anyone to pick up and play.
There is a lot of depth to it, and it holds up well even after a couple
of decades.
