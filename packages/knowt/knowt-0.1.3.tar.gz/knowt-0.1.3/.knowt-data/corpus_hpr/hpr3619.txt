## hpr3619 :: Linux Inlaws S01E58: Kubernetes and Friends and Sarah

 In this continuation of S01E57 our two chaps discuss how you can take containers from
single instances to production-ready, scalable deployments handling large app stacks
and that new-fangled hipster concept called micro-services. Using the once Google-owned project called Borg which later evolved into something now known as Kubernetes (k8s) as an example,
Martin and Chris discuss typical challenges when using containers as the main infrastructure
to modern workloads. Including such gory topics such as what happens if a container dies and
doesn't go to heaven, contradictions in terms such as ephemeral storage and why many k8s developers
have defected to VMware.
