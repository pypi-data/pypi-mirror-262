## hpr3609 :: Linux Inlaws S01E57: Operating System Level Virtualisation and Martin's Faith

 In this episode our two ageing heroes take a closer at operating system
(OS) level virtualisation. The main different legacy virtualisation
technologies like virtual machines (VMs) and this new-fangled approach is
that the OS kernel remains the same across virtualisation domains, thus giving
the hippsters and other followers of fashion a cheaper and potentially much
faster solution than virtualising the kernel and surrounding hawrdware and all
the rest of it. Plus more details on Martin's real faith. Don't miss out on
this episode if you're interested in any of these...
