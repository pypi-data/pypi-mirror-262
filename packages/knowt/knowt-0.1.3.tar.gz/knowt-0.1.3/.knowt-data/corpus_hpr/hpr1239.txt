## hpr1239 :: HPR Saturday Sessions: What is hacking?

 
Nido is joined by dude-man, Epicanis, and artv61 to 
discuss how one could or should define "Hacker" and "Hacking", particularly in 
reference to the "Hackers" that Hacker Public Radio episodes are intended to be
"of interest to". Unfortunately, all participants seemed to be largely in
agreement with each other, so there isn't enough contention to make the 
discussion dramatic. Listeners may find the discussion insightful anyway,
and we do come up with some suggestions and ultimately encourage everyone to
be a lot more public about using the words "hacker" and "hacking" as
much as possible outside the context of criminal and computer-programming
activity until outdated dictionaries finally update their definitions.
Although Nido deserves the credit for Saturday Sessions, recording, cleanup, 
and editing of today's session was done by Epicanis, so if the sound sucks
it's all his fault and not Nido's.  Same goes for these show notes.
