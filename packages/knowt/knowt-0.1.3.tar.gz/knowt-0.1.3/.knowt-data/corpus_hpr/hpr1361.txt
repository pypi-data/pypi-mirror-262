The Software Freedom Society/School is a local movement to help anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of free software. Linux Camp, the latest success of SFS is discussed along with several of our other past and future projects.


We hope to do another show soon, a Linux Camp Radio Show. We said in this interview that Linux Camp was a series of "real world task" labs, and we think that with a little work, they would make a good radio show. A show that an aspiring Linux SysAdmin, especially one that is studying for the LPIC-1 exams, could use as a list of challenge tasks to reinforce their skills.


This is the book that we're using in our study groups:


  CompTIA Linux+ Study Guide
  Publication Date: January 14, 2013
  ISBN-10: 1118531744
  ISBN-13: 978-1118531747


The Linux Camp document is here for now:


https://zimbra.thegeek.nu/home/dlwillson@thegeek.nu/Shared/SFS/Linux%20Camp%202013/SFS%20Linux%20Camp.odt


Eventually, we'll clean it up and put it on our website.


Our goal is to build a fully free (libre) knowledge-sharing group with learning and payment options that work for everyone, from the penny-pinching enthusiast to the well-funded professional.


To that end, we want your suggestions and welcome your feedback!
