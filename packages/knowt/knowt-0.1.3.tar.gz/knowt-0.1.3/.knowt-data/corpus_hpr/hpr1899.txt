## hpr1899 :: MyTinyTodo List

 This show is about my favorite tool to keep track of stuff I have to do, stuff I want to do, gift ideas for my family, books I want to read, HPR topics to record, etc. It's called MyTinyTodo. It's a web app that you can host on your own server and access from any device that has a web browser.
The website claims that it is already mobile friendly, but I did not like the mobile interface they had, and also did not like the fact that I had to use a different URL to get the mobile interface, so I hacked the stylesheet and the index.html file in the code to make it a responsive design. Now it looks great on all of my devices.
