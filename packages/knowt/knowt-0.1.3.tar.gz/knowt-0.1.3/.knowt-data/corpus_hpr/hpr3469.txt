## hpr3469 :: Linux Inlaws S01E43: The Great Battle or not

 In this episode Martin and one of the Grumpies (as in Grumpy Old Coders)
battle it out: SQL or NoSQL - which technology is better? If you ever wondered
why the Structured Query Language was invented in the first place and why the
hipster abandoned ship for the latest (?) rage of the likes of the NoSQL
variety, this is for you. Plus: A whole family of never-heard-of sound effects
make their debut on this bumper of an episode.
