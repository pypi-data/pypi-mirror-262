 Battling with English - part 3
Some word confusions
In this episode, the third of this series, I’m looking at some words that are sometimes used in the wrong places, often being confused one with another. These words are often particularly difficult to differentiate by people for whom English is not their first language.
Long notes
As usual I have provided detailed notes and examples for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
