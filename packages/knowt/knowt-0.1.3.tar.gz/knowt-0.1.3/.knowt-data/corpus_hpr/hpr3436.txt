contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

Older HPR shows on archive.org
This month 5 additional shows in the range 1-870 have been uploaded.
Since we don't want to upload shows without summaries or tags the old shows and tag and summary projects are now tied together. So we will be all the more welcoming of tag and summary updates submitted as described on the summary page.
Tags and Summaries
Thanks to the following contributors for sending in updates in the past month:
Archer72, Rho`n
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 76 shows which were without them.
There are currently 38 shows which need a summary and/or tags.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
