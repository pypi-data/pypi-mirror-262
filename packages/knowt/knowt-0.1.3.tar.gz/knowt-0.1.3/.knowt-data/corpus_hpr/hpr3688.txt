## hpr3688 :: Education, Certifications, and sipping on the Socials

 I have had a lot of questions over the years about how to proceed with a career, education, and certifications. So, I give my take on these and what they mean relative to my life experiences. Individual mileage may vary. I also discuss the need to have a public facing social media presence that is active and consistent. Hide the private Socials and search to see what actually shows up when searching for yourself. Your future employers will. Just sayin'.
