 Biking to Work
In this episode I record while I'm riding my bicycle to work, using my new audio adapter to plug my $2 microphone into my phone. To make the recording I used the Hi-Q mp3 recorder app on my Android device. In the end I didn't do anything in post-production to adjust the volume or compression of the audio. It turned out pretty well "as is."
