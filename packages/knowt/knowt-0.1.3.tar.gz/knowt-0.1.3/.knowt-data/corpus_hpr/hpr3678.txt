## hpr3678 :: "Stupid Users" ... no, not those users, the other "stupid users"

 In this week's episode, I chat with R. Brady Frost about the little plumber vs the gigantic rock. Then we move in to a discussion about the fallacy of stupid users with some great stories of stupid things done by those of us who really should know better. The moral of the story, is that we are all human and nothing will ever change that. Instead, we need to be prepared for when humans are human.
