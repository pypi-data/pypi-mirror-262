## hpr2923 :: Describing how I listen to podcasts PART 5

 Below are examples of messages shown on the screen during operation
System Up (Unfortunately I didn’t get a picture of this message)

Shows the unit waiting to get a wi-fi connection and get given an IP address.

Unit goes to the HPR site and gets the number of days to free slot in the show queue. At the time when I took the picture the queue had a healthy 22 shows!
Links to three previous shows I did that mention the Blinkstick

Example of a message being sent to the unit telling me that a backup is complete. The bright pink LED on the Blinkstick lets me know at a glance that a message has been sent to the display.

A flavour of what information is shown when the information button 2 is pushed. The picture showing the title scrolling from right to left was blurred so I didn’t include this.

The menu displayed during seek, this in initiated by pushing and releasing the toggle button while either in the Podcasts main menu 0 or Audio book main menu 1.

The shut-down menu this in initiated by pushing and releasing the toggle button while in the System main menu 2.
