 XGP-save-extractor
Python script to extract/backup savefiles out of Xbox Game Pass for
PC games.
When run, the script produces a ZIP file for each supported game save
found in the system.
In most cases the files in the ZIP can be copied to the save
directory of the Steam/Epic version of the game. To find out the save
file location, check PCGamingWiki.
