 Extra ancillary Bash tips - 13
Making decisions in Bash
This is the thirteenth episode in the Bash Tips sub-series. It is the fifth and final of a group of shows about making decisions in Bash.
In the last four episodes we saw the types of test Bash provides, and we looked briefly at some of the commands that use these tests. We looked at conditional expressions and all of the operators Bash provides to do this. We concentrated particularly on string comparisons which use glob and extended glob patterns then we devoted an episode to Bash regular expressions.
Now we want to look at the final topic within regular expressions, the use of capture groups.
