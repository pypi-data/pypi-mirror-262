## hpr1175 :: how to start irssi in screen after reboot

 
In this episode Lord Drachenblut shows us how to start irssi in screen after reboot.


crontab -e # opens editor for crontab 
@reboot /usr/bin/screen -dmUS irc /usr/bin/irssi


-d -m   Start screen in "detached" mode. This creates a new session but doesn't attach to it. This is useful for system startup scripts.
       -U   Run  screen  in  UTF-8  mode.  This  option tells screen that your terminal sends and understands UTF-8 encoded characters. It also sets the
            default encoding for new windows to `utf8'.
       -S sessionname
            When creating a new session, this option can be used to specify a meaningful name for the session. This  name  identifies  the  session  for
            "screen -list" and "screen -r" actions. It substitutes the default [tty.host] suffix.
