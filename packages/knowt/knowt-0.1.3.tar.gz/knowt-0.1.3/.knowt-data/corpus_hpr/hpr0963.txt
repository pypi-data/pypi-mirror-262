## hpr0963 :: How I cut the cord part 3

 Hello H.P.R.
BrocktonBob here in my third episode on how I cut the cable cord. I discuss https://www.eztv.it/
using this website we will be able using a bittorent client like transmission to download our 
favorite cable and network T.V. Programs. We also talk about putting these shows on an external harddrive.
And how to convert them to any video codec and play them using the Netgear settop box.
