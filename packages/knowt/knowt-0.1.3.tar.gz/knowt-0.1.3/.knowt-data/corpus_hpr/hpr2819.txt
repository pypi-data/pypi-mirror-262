## hpr2819 :: Reply to Knightwise - podcasts

 Knightwise, in HPR 2798, made the argument that podcasts are better if they are done by "pirates", i.e.Â not by corporations, but by individuals with something to say. While I see some merit in this view, I think the more significant feature of podcasts is that it gets us away from "broadcasting" (shows aimed at the lowest common denominator) and towards "narrowcasting", an environment where small niche interests can find an audience and thrive since podcasting does not require a lot of resources. But I do appreciate the chance to hear some radio programs that I would not otherwise be able to listen to when they are offered as podcasts.
