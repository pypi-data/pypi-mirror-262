## hpr3668 :: Linux Inlaws S01E63: John Hawley on kernel dot org and other shenanigans

 In this episode Martin and Chris host John Hawley of kernel.org fame. The
discussion centers around Python, the royal British family and other FLOSS
topics such as some break-away colonies like the US, version control systems,
wireless wikis and containers. Never mind Python. Did I mention Python? :-)
And perhaps VMware. Ever wondered why early versions of git just gobbled up
your main memory? You may or may not find the answer in this episode. Or its
outtakes...
