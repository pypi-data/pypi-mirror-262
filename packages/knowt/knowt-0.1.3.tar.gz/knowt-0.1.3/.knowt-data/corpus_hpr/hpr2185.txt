## hpr2185 :: Soldering a Soldering Fan

 
In the episodes hpr1037 :: Soldering Part 1 and hpr1047 :: Soldering Part 2: An audio demonstration of soldering, MrX inspired me to get into soldering. It's easy and if audio isn't your thing there is always the SOLDERING IS EASY complete comic book.


For my first project, I soldered a 12v power supply I got for â‚¬0 at the recycle shop, to a 12V fan from my old computer tower.



The result a ugly solder joint, but a working project.
