## hpr1085 :: A Stream

 Back in episode 1058, OggCamp12 Hardware Hackers, (https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1058) we met Zack at the hardware village at OggCamp12. He was busy with his project to orchestrate music based on the movement of a Kite.

Today he sent us in a recording of a stream. Ideal to use as ambient noise in the workplace or in your audio dramas. He has uploaded it to www.freesound.org but we will also host the flac version of the original and of the edited show
