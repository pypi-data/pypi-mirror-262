key fobs compromised in European nations (France, Spain, and
Latvia). On October 10, 2022, European authorities arrested 31
suspects across three nations. The suspects are believed to be related
to a cybercrime ring that allegedly advertised an “automotive diagnostic
solution” online and sent out fraudulent packages to their victims. The
fraudulent packages contained malware and once installed onto the
victims vehicle, the attackers were able to unlock the vehicle, start
the ignition, then steal the vehicle without the physical key fob.
European authorities confiscated over €1 million in criminal assets
(malicious software, tools, and an online domain).
Microsoft
Office 365 has a broken encryption algorithm. Microsoft Office 365
uses an encryption algorithm called “Office 365 Message Encryption” to
send and receive encrypted email messages. The messages are encrypted in
an Electronic Codebook (ECB). The U.S. National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) reported, "ECB mode encrypts plaintext blocks
independently, without randomization; therefore, the inspection of any
two ciphertext blocks reveals whether or not the corresponding plaintext
blocks are equal". Emails can be harvested today then decrypted later
for future attacks.

crackdown on freeloaders. Netflix is testing in Argentina, the
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras Chile, Costa
Rica and Peru different
efforts to crackdown on freeloaders. The term “freeloaders” covers
the multiple users sharing a single Netflix account from different
locations. Netflix plans to charge an additional $3.00 - $4.00 per
subaccount.
Samsung
implements private blockchain to link user devices. While claiming
the private blockchain, “has nothing to do with cryptomining”, the Knox
Matrix security system links all your devices together in a private
blockchain instead using a server based group verification system. The
system, Knox Matrix, is suppose to allow devices to “manage themselves”
by auto updating, caching updates for other devices then distributing
the updates to other devices on the private blockchain.
