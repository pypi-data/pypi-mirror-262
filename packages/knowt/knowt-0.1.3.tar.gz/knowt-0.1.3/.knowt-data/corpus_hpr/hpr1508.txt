## hpr1508 :: In Defense of Play

 
This episode is a just-for-fun show in which I make a few observations in defense of just playing around.  We need to 
stop worrying about work and to-do lists every once in a while in order to just get up off our chairs and do something
that is fun.  It doesn't have to have a structure at first, but it should involve a challenge or exposure to at least
one new thing, or place, or person, or idea.

I think it is the best way to learn, because the knowledge and acquisition of skills sneak up on you while you are
having fun.  It may be the only way to make learning really stick, and to stick with the learning process.
