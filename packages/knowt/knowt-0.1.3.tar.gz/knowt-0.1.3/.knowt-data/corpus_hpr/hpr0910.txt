## hpr0910 :: Introduction to Pagekite.

 
Welcome to my awkward second episode.
Today I'll be introducing you to pagekite, a service for giving a public face to your local servers.
Check it out at https://www.pagekite.net


Bring your localhost servers on-line.

PageKite is software that gives your localhost servers names and makes them globally visible. It works with any computer and any Internet connection.
It's so easy you'll never want to think about routers, IP addresses or other technicalities again. It's open source, too!
