## hpr0490 :: TIT Radio Ep 13.1ec

 From PC Radio Show website:

"Our guest was Richard Stallman, the man behind GNU and the Free Software Foundation. He condemns the Amazon Kindle (his term for it is the "swindle")
because it takes away freedoms that readers of hardcopy books enjoy.
Freedoms such as the ability to lend a book to a friend, to borrow one
from a library, to buy one anonymously by paying cash, to keep a book
as long as we like and to give it away. The Amazon Kindle implements DRM
- digital rights management - to restrict your use of books. He is not
against eBook readers per se, just the DRM, which in addition to the
above also requires you to run proprietary software to read eBooks. He
urged listeners to go to Defectivebydesign.org and sign up to participate in his protests."
