## hpr2924 :: Hacking an Alarm Clock to Make it Quieter

 The alarm clock on my bedside table had a very loud alarmâ€”so loud that it scared me and made my heart race when it went off. I know you're thinking I should just use an alarm on my phone, but for whatever reason I wanted to use the alarm clock. In this episode I talk about installing a resistor in the speaker wires of the alarm clock so that it won't be so loud when it goes off. It's all good now. Loud enough to wake me up, but not so loud that it scares everyone.
