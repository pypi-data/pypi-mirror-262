## hpr3368 :: Infosec Podcasts Part 4 - Social Engineering Podcasts

 Inoffensive in every region of the world
Special thanks to Thaj for sharing "Audio for Podcasting: Episode 2 - Equalization" (HPR3345 - https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=3345 ). I will be trying to apply some of his advice in this recording.
In case you have not heard my previous episodes, this introduction may be helpful. If you have already listened to my previous 3 episodes, I apologize for this sounding redundant.
Why am I recording this series?
As I reviewed the HPR List of Recommended Topics, "What podcasts you listen to" jumped off the screen at me.
I am passionate about information security
We desperately need people to fill infosec jobs in many different specialties, including
Security operations, engineering, & architecture
Governance Risk, & Compliance
Application Security
Security Education
More...
Infosec is a rapidly changing field, and it is critical to stay current
As a result I listen to TONS of infosec related podcasts
Because there are so many podcasts to list, I have broken them down into 6 different episodes based on topics:

Part 1 - News & Current Events
Part 2 - General Information Security
Part 3 - Career & Personal Development
Part 4 - Social Engineering
Part 5 -

Hacks & Attacks
Technical Information & Learning
Infosec Community / Social / History

Part 6 - Infosec Leadership

Part 4
Social Engineering
Note: Social Engineering has a special place in my heart. In a previous life, I developed and ran the security awareness program for a large organization. I based the program on many of the threats we experienced on a daily basis, and the challenges users encountered, and sometimes fell for. As a result, much of the material addressed detecting and reporting social engineering attacks.
