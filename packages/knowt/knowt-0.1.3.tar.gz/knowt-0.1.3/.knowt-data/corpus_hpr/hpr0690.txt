## hpr0690 :: Resources for Autodidacts

 Proposal for a new HPR "series"
What web resources (instructional sites, podcasts, video tutorials) and dead-tree resources have you found helpful in learning Linux, programming, and F/LOSS software?  In the tradition of our standard contributor podcasts (like “How I Got Started with Linux” or “My First Computer”), Curbuntu proposes an ongoing category in which we share these learning resources with each other.
The topic is kicked off with these suggestions:

The Hewlett-Packard Learning Center (https://h30187.www3.hp.com/all_courses.jsp).  While signing in with a username and password is required, the courses at the site are free.
The ODFAuthors.org site (https://www.odfauthors.org), the place to find outstanding, comprehensive, and (best of all) free manuals for the various OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice modules like Writer, Calc, and Impress.
An example of the printed, for-pay versions of the ODFAuthors.org books can be found at https://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/openofficeorg-3-writer-guide/6570202.
