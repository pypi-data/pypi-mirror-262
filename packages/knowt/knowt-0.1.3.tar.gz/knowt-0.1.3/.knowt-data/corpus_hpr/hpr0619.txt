## hpr0619 :: QSK: Episode 5: You're Driving Me Crazy

 
In this episode of the QSK Netcast, your hero takes his road rage into the netcast arena. With a top-ten list of bad driving buffoonery to choose from, I stand on my soapbox for an entire episode and spout off to my heart's content. Be warned, the explicit tag on this episode means EXPLICIT.  No two ways about it. It just so happens that when I'm passionate about something, I don't hold anything back. Please enjoy this latest episode and tell all your friends about the show. Don't forget to send feedback, too. I'd love to hear what you think.
