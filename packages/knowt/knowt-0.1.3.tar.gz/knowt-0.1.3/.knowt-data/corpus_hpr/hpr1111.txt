Reshaping HPR

There has been a lot of activity on the mail list this month about changes to the scheduling rules and about the upload formats. 


Please start by (re)listening to 0560 - Old soldiers | 2010-08-02


As we didn't have shows to fill the feed, we introduced other Non-HPR exclusive content to fill the gaps.
As contributions increased this resulted in a long delay in getting the HPR exclusive content out. 
The rest can be read via manually created mail archive https://hackerpublicradio.org/archive/hpr-at-hackerpublicradio.org_2012-10-archive.pdf


There is also a discussion about changing the upload to FLAC only

Dev News

The cpanel website is giving problems and Josh is working to get them fixed. 

mordancy pointed out that we didn't have a full feed for the ogg and spx. So after thinking about it for too long these have also been added.


We made some clean up to the website so please have a look around and report anything out of the ordinary.


Epicanis has been working on a upload form which can be found https://hpr.dogphilosophy.net/hprup.php
