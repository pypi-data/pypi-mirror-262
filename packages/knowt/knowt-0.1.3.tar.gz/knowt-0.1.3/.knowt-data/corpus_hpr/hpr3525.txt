 Confusing plurals
In this episode, the fourth of this series, I’m looking at some words that have singular and plural forms that are very different. These lead to a lot of confusion as we’ll see.
I also want to look at the way that English is evolving in some very strange and apparently senseless ways!
Personal note: I notice I started preparing this show in 2019; unfortunately, COVID messed up my productivity for the next two years, but I hope I can now begin to be productive again! 
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed by following the full notes link.
