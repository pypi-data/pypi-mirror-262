## hpr1248 :: Frank Bell Achieves Enlightenment Adventures with E17 Pt One

 
There was great rejoicing in the Linux community when the Enlightenment Desktop, v. 0.17 (AKA E17), was released recently.  It was the first major upgrade in well over a decade to a desktop environment that many remembered fondly for its commitment to a visually pleasing computing experience.  


Frank Bell describes how he started using Enlightenment and what he has encountered so far.  In this, the first of two parts, he addresses installing Enlightenment, Enlightenment's "first-run" dialog, the structure of the desktop, the menu, and the management applications and windows on the desktop.  


Part Two will focus on the nitty-gritty of configuring the appearance and behavior of Enlightenment.
