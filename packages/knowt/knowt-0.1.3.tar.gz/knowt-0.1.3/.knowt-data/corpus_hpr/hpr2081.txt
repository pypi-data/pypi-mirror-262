 Fixing my daughter’s laptop
My daughter is a student at university and uses her laptop with a headset most of the time. She shares a flat with a friend and they are both studying, so they don’t want to annoy each other with noise.
The headset my daughter uses has a very long cable and earlier this year she tripped over it. The microphone jack was OK, but the headphone jack snapped off at the first ring and the remaining piece was left in the socket.
This episode is about my attempt to remove the broken piece of the jack plug. To find out more about the method I used and how successful it was see the full notes with pictures here.
