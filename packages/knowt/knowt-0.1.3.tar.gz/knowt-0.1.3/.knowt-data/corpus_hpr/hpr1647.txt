## hpr1647 :: Oggcast Planet Live 2014: The Cooking Show

 
OggCast 2014. we cook dinner, I drink beer, a time is had by all.  I'd like to amp this, but Audacity won't let me, so listen carefully.


Broam, Briptastic, and FiftyOneFifty talk about the meal they are making for Saturday Night at Oggcast Planet Live 2014 from when they thought about it until dinner was served, as well as that day's fun at Knoebels theme park at Elysburg PA and the plans to visit the ghost town of Centralia the following day.
