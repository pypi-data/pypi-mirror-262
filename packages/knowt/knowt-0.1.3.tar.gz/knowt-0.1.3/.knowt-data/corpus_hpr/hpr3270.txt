## hpr3270 :: An Example of Using Layers

 There is a point where you need to stop being abstract and start demonstrating what you are talking about, so I thought this was a good opportunity to put some things into practice by creating an image. I chose to do a header image for my site Ahuka Communications that would more accurately reflect the content. This lets us use freely licensed images, an OFL-licensed font, layers, and various tools. Note that you can download all of this stuff from my site.
