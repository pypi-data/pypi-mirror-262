## hpr0005 :: Database 101 Part 1

 
1st part of the Database 101 series with Stankdawg. He defines data as a collection of facts from which conclusions may be drawn while information is the application of data. While a database is a collection of data, regardless of whether it is a text file, spreadsheet etc.


The larger the amount of data the slower text, and spreadsheets get. This is where a database management system comes in. A common database type is a Relational Database like Oracle, Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL or MYSQL
