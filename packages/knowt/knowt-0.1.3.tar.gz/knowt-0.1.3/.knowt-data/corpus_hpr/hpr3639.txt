## hpr3639 :: Linux Inlaws S01E60: The Job Interview

 

In this episode, the Linux Inlaws interview a potential new recruit :-) call Kris Jenkins, from Kafka, an Apache project implementing a scalable distributed event streaming platform (don't know what that is? Listen to the show! :-) . A cautious warning: This episode contains strong philosophical / political views, language and insights which may change your views on messaging systems in general and Kafka in particular. Two hints: Chris shares his view on what a database *really* is and Kris Jenkins tries hard to convince our two aging heroes that he's the man for the job (teaser: he decided to stay at his current position as a dev advocate at Confluent after all). Plus: More on love, death and robots. Interested in the details? Then don't miss this show!
