## hpr3565 :: Heavy Hacking down in the quarry. 

 Another trip down the quarry with Marshall aka Timtimmy. Today he's changing the toggle plate on a MOBICAT MC 120 PRO Jaw Crusher. We've already covered it before but there is a brief refresher about the hydraulic, and pneumatic systems before we get to changing the plate itself. As always be sure you follow the safety instructions provided by the manufacturer.
