## hpr3324 :: Infosec Podcasts Part 1  News and Current Events 

 Inoffensive in every region of the world
Hello, again. This is Trey. This is part 1 of a 6 part series related to information security podcasts.
Why am I recording this series?
"What podcasts you listen to" was on the list of recommended topics
I am passionate about information security
We desperately need people to fill infosec jobs in many different specialties
Infosec is a rapidly changing field, and it is critical to stay current
As a result I listen to TONS of infosec related podcasts
Because there are so many podcasts to list, I will break them down into 6 different episodes based on topics:

Part 1 – News & Current Events
Part 2 – General Information Security
Part 3 - Career & Personal Development
Part 4 – Social Engineering
Part 5 -

Hacks & Attacks
Technical Information & Learning
Infosec Community / Social / History

Part 6 – Infosec Leadership

Part 1
Infosec News / current events podcasts – Why?
Stay aware of what is happening for your own personal growth
If you already work in IT or Infosec, you can have early awareness about attacks to look for indicators of compromise, or learn new tools and techniques
You can get a head start answering questions from leadership, when they ask about something they heard on the news or from a peer.
