## hpr0643 :: What's on my MP3 Player

 
Not all of it it tech, there is some history and some business thrown in there. If I do not listen your show, it is either too smart for me, too awesome for normal listening, or I do not know about it.  Please tell me.


Some of this can be found on https://Hackermedia.org, let me know what the site is missing.
