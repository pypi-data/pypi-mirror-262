## hpr3750 :: Southern Arizona

 We wrap up our stay in Topock, Arizona and move down to Ajo, Arizona, not far from the Mexican border. Kevin gets a head cold and takes it easy for a few days, but we still manage to get out and see some things. At the end we repair our steps and head off to the Tucson area.
