## hpr1349 :: Melissa Dupreast helps me with Audio Compression

 I impose upon Melissa Dupreast to help me learn about audio compression and I make a recording of our session for HPR. Missy is a professional audio engineer, working locally for radio and live sound reinforcement. She is also a recent graduate of our masters program at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and is currently teaching 3 classes for us as an adjunct instructor.
