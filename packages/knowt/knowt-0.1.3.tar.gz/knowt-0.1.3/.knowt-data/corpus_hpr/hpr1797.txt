About:
We're building a sustainable funding platform for freely-licensed works. Our innovative matching pledge creates a network effect where we all work together to support these public goods.


Introducing Snowdrift.coop


Our matching patronage system allows everyone to support FLO projects with minimal risk and maximum impact.


Unlike the one-to-one matching used in traditional fundraising, we use a many-to-many matching pledge that creates a network effect (like the internet itself) so that we all reinforce one another. Unlike one-time fundraising campaigns that help projects get started, Snowdrift.coop pays out monthly to provide sustainability for ongoing work.


Before the times of modern market capitalism, creative workers were supported by wealthy patrons. With Snowdrift.coop, the global community becomes the patron. Instead of businesses deciding the options that we then merely choose from as consumers, we will support and actively work with projects that best serve the interests of the public.
