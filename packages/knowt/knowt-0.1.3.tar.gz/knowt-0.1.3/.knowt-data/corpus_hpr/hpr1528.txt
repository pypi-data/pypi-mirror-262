## hpr1528 :: Wildswimming in France

 In this episode I take a swim along a section of the Charente river near
 Chatain in the Poitou-Charente region of France. I start upstream at the
 bridge and go down as far as the weir, then back. On the way I describe some
 of the things I am seeing, I pass some cows and a couple of French fishermen.
Apologies for the audio quality and panting, this was recorded by an old
 MP3 player cable-tied to a woolly hat.
