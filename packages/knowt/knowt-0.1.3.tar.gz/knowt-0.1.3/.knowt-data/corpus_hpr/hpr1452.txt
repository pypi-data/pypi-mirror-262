00:27:07 KDE

Over at the KDE booth, I managed to track down Jonathan Riddell about the KDE project. From Wikipedia:


KDE is an international free software community producing an integrated set of cross-platform applications designed to run on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows, and OS X systems. It is known for its Plasma Desktop, a desktop environment provided as the default working environment on many Linux distributions, such as openSUSE, Mageia and Kubuntu and is default desktop environment on PC-BSD a BSD operating system.

The goal of the community is to provide basic desktop functions and applications for daily needs as well as tools and documentation for developers to write stand-alone applications for the system. In this regard, the KDE project serves as an umbrella project for many standalone applications and smaller projects that are based on KDE technology. These include Calligra Suite, digiKam, Rekonq, K3b, and many others.

KDE software is based on the Qt framework. The original GPL version of this toolkit only existed for the X11 platform, but with the release of Qt 4, LGPL versions are available for all platforms. This allows KDE software based on Qt 4 to also be distributed to Microsoft Windows and OS X.


About KDE


The KDE Community is an international technology team dedicated to creating a free and user-friendly computing experience, offering an advanced graphical desktop, a wide variety of applications for communication, work, education and entertainment and a platform to easily build new applications upon. We have a strong focus on finding innovative solutions to old and new problems, creating a vibrant atmosphere open for experimentation.


About Kubuntu


Kubuntu is an operating system built by a worldwide team of expert developers. It contains all the applications you need: a web browser, an office suite, media apps, an instant messaging client and many more. Kubuntu is an open-source alternative to Windows and Office.

00:50:13 Drupal

Bumping into old friends is all part of the FOSDEM experience. Never one for missing an opertunity to turn a chat into an episode, I catch up with Paul Krischer, who tells us about his work with Drupal. Keep your diary clear for drupalcon Amsterdam, which will be held 29 SEP - 03 OCT.


Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications. It's built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of people around the world.

01:12:52 CentOS

Starting a series of RedHat interviews we interview Jim Perrin Governing Board member of the CentOS project.





The CentOS trio.

The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproduceable platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). We are now looking to expand on that by creating the resources needed by other communities to come together and be able to buld on the CentOS Linux platform. And today we start the process by delivering a clear governance model, increased transparency and access. In the coming weeks we aim to publish our own roadmap that includes variants of the core CentOS Linux.

01:23:08 RedHat: Foreman, oVirt, and Open Stack

Daniel Lobato and Doran Fedu help me understand what Foreman, oVirt, and OpenStack is all about.

Foreman

Foreman is an open source project that gives system administrators the power to easily automate repetitive tasks, quickly deploy applications, and proactively manage servers, on-premises or in the cloud. (From Wikipedia) Foreman (also known as The Foreman) is a complete life cycle systems management tool for physical and virtual servers with deep integration to configuration management software, specifically Puppet. The Foreman provides provisioning on bare-metal (through managed DHCP, DNS, TFTP, and PXE-based unattended installations), virtualization and cloud. The Foreman provides comprehensive, auditable interaction facilities including a web frontend, command line interface and robust, REST API.

oVirt

oVirt manages virtual machines, storage and virtualized networks. (From Wikipedia) oVirt is a free platform virtualization management web application community project started by Red Hat. oVirt is built on libvirt which could allow it to manage virtual machines hosted on any supported backend, including KVM, Xen and VirtualBox. However, oVirt is currently focused on KVM alone. oVirt is an open source software with backing from Red Hat and it is the base for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

OpenStack

OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface.

01:48:17 Fedora

Completing (for the most part) the RedHat thread we head over to the Fedora Project booth and talk to Jiří Eischmann and Jaroslav Řezník. Jiří is the chair of the Fedora Ambassador Steering Committee, and works for RedHat as a Community Manager. Jaroslav is the Fedora Program Manager.

Fedora Friends

Fedora is a fast, stable, and powerful operating system for everyday use built by a worldwide community of friends. It's completely free to use, study, and share.
