## hpr3457 :: Tables

 
Mobile devices don't display them nicely.
Most tables can be converted into a list:



OSInitPkg


Fedorasystemddnf


SlackwareBSD-styleslackpkg


GentooOpenRCemerge


Can be represented as a list. In YAML terms, this is a sequence of mappings.

Fedora
Init system: systemd
Package manager: dnf

Slackware

Init system: BSD-style
Package manager: slackpkg

Gentoo

Init system: OpenRC
Package manager: emerge


A table doesn't always translate exactly to a list, but it probably can be restructured. 


OSOpen sourceLanded on Mars

LinuxYesYes


BSDYesNo


macOSNoNo


Could be written like this instead:
Linux and BSD are open source operating systems, while macOS is not. Of these POSIX-compliant systems, only Linux has landed on Mars so far.
That's pretty casual and loses the visual impact of a table or a list. So alternately, you could summarize what's common and highlight differences:

There are a few Linux systems on Mars.
Neither BSD or macOS have yet landed on Mars.


Linux and BSD are both open source.
macOS is based partially on open source and includes components from the BSD, KDE, GNU, and other projects.
