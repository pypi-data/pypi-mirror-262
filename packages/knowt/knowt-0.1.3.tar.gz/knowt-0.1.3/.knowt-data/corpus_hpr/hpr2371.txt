Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available in the archives run
externally by Gmane
(see below) and on the HPR server under Mailman.

Note: since the summer of 2016 Gmane has changed location and is currently
being reestablished. At the moment the HPR archive is not available there.
The threaded discussions this month can be found here:

Comment System
As mentioned on the
	mailing
	list, we are working on a new comment system to replace the failing one we have now. We'll be reporting
	progress on the mailing list.
	

Filling the queue
 The queue got very low recently but is now looking healthier. Thanks to
	everyone for their contributions. However, it would be better in
	future if shows could be spread out more to leave room for new contributors and to help prevent the
	feast/famine problem. See the Scheduling Guidelines on the Calendar page:
	

You must have have your audio recording ready to upload before you pick a slot.
Always try and fill any free slots that are available in the upcoming week.
If the queue is filling up then please consider leaving some slots free for new contributors.
If you have a non urgent show then find a empty week and schedule it then.
If you are uploading a series of shows, consider scheduling one every two weeks.


Amateur Radio Round Table
The current proposal is to record the next show on 2017-09-13 at 18:00 UTC.
	Please let Michael (mirwi) know via the HPR mailing list if you'd like to attend.

Tags and Summaries
In the past month we have had contributions from 
	Epicanis
	and Windigo
	and I (Dave
	    Morriss) have added a few tags & summaries myself. Many
	thanks to all contributors.
Currently there are 950 shows which need summaries or tags to be
	added. All contributions to this project are most welcome. See the
	current status and instructions for making your own contribution
	at "Shows without a summary and/or tags".
