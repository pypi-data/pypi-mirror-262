## hpr1384 :: How I Got Into Linux and OSS

 
It seems that telling the tale of how you came to be an active user of Linux or open source software has become the de facto first show topic, so here's my story. I hope this slightly different take on the how-I-came-to-Linux story will be of some interest to you. If you're interested in any of the other things I do you can find me on twitter @kdmurray (https://twitter.com/kdmurray) or on my blog at https://kdmurray.net/.
