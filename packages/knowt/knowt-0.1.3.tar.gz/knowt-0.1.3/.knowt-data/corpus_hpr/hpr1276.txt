## hpr1276 :: Two Hacker Public Radio hosts meet face-to-face for the first time

 I have known windigo for more than 4 years as a virtual
acquaintance, first on the Linux Outlaws
forums, then on identica, and finally on the Federated Statusnet
network. It was awesome when he and his girlfriend stopped by my
house today to visit while on a massive road trip around the
United States. We took advantage of the opportunity to record a
brief conversation for Hacker Public Radio. Here's a photo of
windigo, me, and Dingle the cat between us.
