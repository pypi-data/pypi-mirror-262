## hpr3658 :: Linux Inlaws S01E62: HPR's inner workings

 In this episode our two ageing heroes explore the inner workings of a podcast (or podcast hosting platform depending on your perspective) called Hacker Public Radio. Yes, the platform that the Inlaws have been using since the very inception of this rapidly growing FLOSS podcast content. Wondering what the heck this episode is all about, why exactly Martin and Chris are talking about this now and the importance of statistics, lies and damned lies? Then just listen to this episode. You may also find out the difference between mere caching and content syndication. Never mind  HPR's inner workings.
