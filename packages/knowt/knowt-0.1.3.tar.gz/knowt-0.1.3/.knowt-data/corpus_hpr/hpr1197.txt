## hpr1197 :: What I do with bash scripts

 In this episode I talk about the way I use shell scripting on a
day-to-day basis. I am not employed in a technical field, so the
fact that I use shell scripts at all surprises most people. I am
just a music history professor with an enthusiasm for Linux and
free software. Although I have dabbled a bit with Python, I don't
feel nearly as comfortable with Python as I do with bash, so all
of the scripts I mention in this episode are written for bash.  
Here are links to blog posts about some of the scripts mentioned
in the show.
