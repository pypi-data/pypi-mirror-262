 More ancillary Bash tips - 10
Making decisions in Bash
This is my tenth contribution to the Bash Scripting series under the heading of Bash Tips. The previous episodes are listed below in the Links section.
We are currently looking at decision making in Bash, and in the last episode we examined the tests themselves. In this episode we’ll look at the constructs that use these tests: looping constructs, conditional constructs and lists of commands.
Note: this episode and the preceding one were originally recorded as a single episode, but because it was so long it was split into two. As a consequence the audio contains references to examples such as bash9_ex2.sh where the true name is bash10_ex1.sh. The notes have been updated as necessary but not the audio.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
