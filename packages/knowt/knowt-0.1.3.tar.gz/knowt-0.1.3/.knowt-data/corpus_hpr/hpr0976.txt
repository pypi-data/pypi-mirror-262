Other News

Deep geek will be taking some time off from recording Talk Geek to Me, to upgrade some of his technology. He should be back in June or July.


David Whitman says that the HPR conference kit, such as it is, has arrived safely and in time for LFNW (https://linuxfestnorthwest.org/). He has built quite a display to go behind the table, and he'll probably draw quite a crowd. He's making good use of Ken's presentation slides too, and those will play on a loop at the table. LFNW is going on as we record this, so we hope to hear back from David this month.
