## hpr2301 :: Baofeng UV5R VHF/UHF Handset part 3

 This episode will be right up your street if you like rambling podcasts.
I planned to cover the supplied accessories of the Baofeng UV5R VHF / UHF Hand Held Transceiver however somewhere along the line I rambled off topic and started blathering on about a whole range of topics.
I cover the VHF / UHF spectrum, radio frequency, wavelength Omni-directional antennas, mains hum time stamp fingerprinting among other things.
Sit back and enjoy.
