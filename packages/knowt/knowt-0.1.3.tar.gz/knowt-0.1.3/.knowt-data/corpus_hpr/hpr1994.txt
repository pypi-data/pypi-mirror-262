## hpr1994 :: Truck Repair: Serpentine Belt Replacement

 Come along for the ride as I repair my pickup truck. The job is to replace the serpentine belt, idler pulley, and belt tensioner in the hope of getting rid of a very annoying loud chirping sound that was coming from my engine. Even after cutting out the long pauses where I was staring at my engine trying to imagine how I was going to get the belt to go in the indicated pattern, this episode still tops out at about one hour. Be warned. There are several sections where you're just kind of listening along to sounds of nature as I work.
Here's the instructional video I watched to learn how to do it:
