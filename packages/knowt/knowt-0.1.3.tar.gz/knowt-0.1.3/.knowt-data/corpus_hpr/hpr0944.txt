## hpr0944 :: LITS 002: tr

 In the third in the series, Dann introduces us to the tr command. 


Here's a flavour:

The tr, or translate (aka: transliterate) command, substitutes one more characters for another set of characters or it will delete a specified set of characters.  The tr command takes input from standard in and writes to standard out.  This simple example of the tr command translates some numbers into a word:

echo "12234" |tr '1234' 'aple'

The output:

apple
