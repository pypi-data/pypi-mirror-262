## hpr2688 :: Explaining the controls on my Amateur HF Radio Part 5

 
The controls covered are

AF / RF gain

(1A) AF, Audio frequency gain control (Volume)
Turns the volume up and down
(1B) RF, Radiofrequency gain control (From the Kenwood manual)
RF GAIN is controlled by changing the AGC (Auto Gain Control) threshold voltage. Adjusting the RF GAIN so that the S-meter reading increases to a point just lower than speech peaks. This also reduces noise during reception. For normal operation, this control should be turned fully clockwise for maximum sensitivity.

CW VBT (From the Kenwood manual)

Carrier Wave Variable Bandwidth Tuning Control
This control is very similar to the SSB Slope tuning controls. However, with the CW VBT control, both sides of the IF passband are narrowed at the same time.

SSB Slope Tune (High pass low pass audio filter)

I mention that the radio uses phase locked loop technologies.

I mention that the radio doesnâ€™t use valves.

Dry joint
I mention that the radio developed a dry joint
