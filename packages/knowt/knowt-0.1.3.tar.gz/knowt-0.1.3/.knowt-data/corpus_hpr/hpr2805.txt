## hpr2805 :: My 50th Show

 Hallo this is again Tony Hughes for HPR. This is an auspicious show for me as it’s my 50th show that I have recorded and released on HPR in my own right. However prior to my 1st show in my own right I did guest on 2 shows.
The first of these was:

hpr0844 :: The Flying Handbag hosted by HPR Volunteers
Released: 2011-10-26

Which was a show that was recorded at Barcamp Blackpool in 2011, when a group of us got together to record a podcast, the hilarious thing was that the only place we could find to record was a stairwell which happened to be next to the toilets, definitely not family friendly but if you want a laugh have a listen.
The next show I appeared on was an interview I did with Ken Fallon at my first OggCamp in the same year.

hpr0863 :: Tony Hughes Free Cycle hosted by Ken Fallon
Released: 2011-11-22.

Ken was as usual trying to recruit new hosts and interviewed me with the hope that I would become one. Well I did but it took another 5 years before I finally recorded my first show in my own right.
First just to say the idea for this show comes from hpr2700 in which Ken created a script to automate the bot voice reading a list of every show that has been released on HPR, so to celebrate my 50th Show I thought I would list my shows but with me running through them and do a brief summary of the show where appropriate.
