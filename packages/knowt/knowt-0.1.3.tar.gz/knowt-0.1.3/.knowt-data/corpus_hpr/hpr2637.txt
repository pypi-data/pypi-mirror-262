Ranger for the win

Ranger is a free console file manager that gives you greater flexibility and a good overview of your files without having to leave your *nix console. It visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory hierarchy on one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right so you know where youâ€™ll be going.
The scope functionality is where converting to text pays off. Located at $HOME/.config/ranger/scope.sh, scope is the feature that allows for file preview from inside the console. Text files are highlighted based on their file extension, for non-text files, different converters can be used to coerce the file into a text representation. Some items are available out of the box, but the configuration is written in such a way that any text can be presented in the preview screen.
The basic format of the scope switch statement is as follows:

case "$extension" in
    odt|odp)
        try odt2txt "$path" && { dump | trim | fmt -s -w $width; exit 0; };;
