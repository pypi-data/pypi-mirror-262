## hpr1350 :: The Origin of ONICS (My Intro)

 
This show is about the Open Network Inspection Command Suite (ONICS).  
It is a project I have been working on at home for a couple of years now.
The idea is to create a set of command line tools that work like cat, sed,
awk, grep, etc but for network packets instead of lines of text.  This
podcast is actually less about the tools and more about the process that
I went through to build it.  So its more a tale of the project that was
never done than an explanation of how to use the tools.
