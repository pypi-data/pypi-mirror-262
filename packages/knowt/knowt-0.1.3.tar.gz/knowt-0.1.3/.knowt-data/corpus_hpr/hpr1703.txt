## hpr1703 :: Open Source CD Rippers

 
For a first attempt at flying solo for an episode of HPR, Kevie takes a look at a variety of open source CD ripping software. Looking at graphical applications 
https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/SoundJuicer: Sound Juicer and
https://littlesvr.ca/asunder/: Asunder along with the command line tools
https://bashburn.dose.se/: Bashburn and
https://bach.dynet.com/crip/: Crip. Along with considering if it is worth having a dedicated ripping tool when a fully fledged audio suite
https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox/: Rhythmbox and
https://www.videolan.org/vlc/: VLC will also allow ripping.

Regular listeners to the https://unseenstudio.co.uk/category/tuxjam-ogg/: TuxJam podcast will know that Kevie is a big fan of creative commons music and this episode is no different with the tracks by https://20lb.net/: 20lb Sounds and https://bridgesplosion.bandcamp.com/: Blowing Up Bridges.
