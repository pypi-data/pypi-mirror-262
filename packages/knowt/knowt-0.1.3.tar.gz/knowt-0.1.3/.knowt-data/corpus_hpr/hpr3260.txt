## hpr3260 :: Free, Public Domain and Creative Commons Assets

 In preparation for doing some sample exercises I wanted to first explain about how you can use images and fonts that are not restricted or are available under license terms that are not too restrictive. Any image that is intended for public display or for commercial purposes could be liable for copyright infringement if care is not taken. Fortunately, there are many resources available that you can use, and we look at some of the better ones.
