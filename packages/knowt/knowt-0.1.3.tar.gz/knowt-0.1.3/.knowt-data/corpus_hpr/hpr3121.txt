## hpr3121 :: Opposing Views on Tattoos

 
Note: Phone recording came with a little bit of a hiss. Sorry about that!


I discuss the subject of tattoos with my partner of fifteen years, Mrs. Honeyhume. While we agree on many subjects, tattoos are not one of them.


She enjoys and appreciates tattoos, seeing them as a permanent form of art that you can display on your own body. She has several of her own. I do not mind if other people tattoo themselves, but I am very opposed to getting them myself.


We discuss cultural influences of tattooing, some different methods used to tattoo skin, and many hypothetical situations to try to pin down the source of my opposition to getting one.
