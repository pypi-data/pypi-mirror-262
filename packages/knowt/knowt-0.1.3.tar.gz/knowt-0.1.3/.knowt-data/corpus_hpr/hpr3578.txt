## hpr3578 :: Linux Inlaws S01E54: Electronic Freedom Never Mind the Civil Rest

 In this episode our two hosts talk to an eclectic panel consisting of

intellectual capital and why this still matters in socialist America are the
focus of discussion. Plus Chris manages to recount most of the founding
fathers of the US (gaps may be present... :-)
