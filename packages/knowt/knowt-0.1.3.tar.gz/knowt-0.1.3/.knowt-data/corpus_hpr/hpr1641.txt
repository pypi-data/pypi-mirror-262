## hpr1641 :: The real reasons for using Linux

 
I am a Linux user since the end of 1999. Which is 15 years already. I've
also been trying for almost 15 years to convince other people to try Linux.
And I must confess that I very often used wrong arguments doing this.
After 15 years it is time to ditch some fake arguments,
and to tell you the real reasons why you should switch to Linux. :-)


I apology for the bad audio quality. A full transcript of this episode
