## hpr3207 :: Fireside chat with E Nigma

 In this rambling episode, we talk to Enigma about the old days of HPR. He helped out with Today With A Techie and Droops asked him if he would like lead the project. After 300 episodes he, Dual Parallel, Droops, and  StankDawg decided to pivot and rebrand as Hacker Public Radio. A nod to National Public Radio.
