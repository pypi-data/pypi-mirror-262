## hpr2838 :: Why Haskell?

 I got really good comment on episode 2778 - Functor and applicative in Haskell from Beeza that I’m including below:

I’ve been writing software for over 30 years but I find the syntax of Haskell anything but intuitive - in fact less so than any other programming language I have looked at. Thanks to your excellent show notes I can make sense of it but I have to say I would not like to have to develop a project using this language.


Obviously I am missing the point as nobody would design a language with the intention of its being difficult to use. Perhaps you could produce another episode addressing the question “Why Haskell?”

In this episode, I’m trying to answer to that from my point of view.
