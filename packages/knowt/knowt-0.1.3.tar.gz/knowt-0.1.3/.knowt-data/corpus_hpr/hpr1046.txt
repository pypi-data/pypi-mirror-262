Ohio LinuxFest 2012 Registration is Open for Business

A message from Kevin O'Brien
We are opening up Registration for the 2012 Ohio LinuxFest event, and we'd appreciate it if you could pass along this message through whichever social media you prefer. The Registration page is at https://ohiolinux.org/register

AccessibleComputingFoundation fundraiser

We would like to announce the first fundraiser for the Accessible Computing Foundation!. It will be held on August 25 from 12pm EST until 12am EST August 26. This event will be streamed at The New Radiofor the entire event. It's going to be held over at Linux Basix, using their Mumble server. To find out the information for the Mumble server, please visit the Linuxbasixsite . We'll be able to have up to 30 people in the room at once, so come and join us in talking about accessibility and Free software.

So far, joining the event we will be having Jono Bacon from Ubuntu, and Zack the Debian project leader. If you'd like to speak with either of them, please come and join us on August 25. The goal for this fundraiser is to have 1000 people become members of the ACF at $2 a month. We have 3 other levels of membership options if anyone is interested. This would be a great help to the foundation and really get us off of the ground to start bridging the gap between accessibility and technology.

The reason we're focusing on the $2/month level is because it's only 50 cents a week and we think this is a goal most people could meet, even if living on a fixed income like so many people with disabilities. Since monthly membership is so low, we are really depending on MANY people to become members to make this difference. Granted $2 a month isn't much, but if we can get a large number of people thinking this way, it will add up quickly and help out the Accessible Computing Foundation in a great way. So please, join us on August 25 and help bring Accessible Freedom to people around the world!
