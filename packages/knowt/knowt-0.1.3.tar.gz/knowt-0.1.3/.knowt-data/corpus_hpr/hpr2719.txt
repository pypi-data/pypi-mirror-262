## hpr2719 :: Bash Tips - 17

 Bash Tips - 17 (Additional auxiliary Bash tips)
Arrays in Bash
This is the second of a small group of shows on the subject of arrays in Bash. It is also the seventeenth show in the Bash Tips sub-series.
In the last show we saw the two types of arrays, and learned about the multiple ways of creating them and populating them. We also looked at how array elements and entire arrays are accessed.
Now we want to continue looking at array access and some of the various parameter expansion operations available.
Long notes
I have provided detailed notes as usual for this episode, and these can be viewed here.
