## hpr3973 :: Creating an equalizer preset for your episodes of HPR

 Here I describe my method for creating a macro using equalizer,
compressor and normalize presets in Audacity, which can be used
repeatedly to get consistent results, as long as you use the same voice,
microphone and recording location.
This is the sample of the equalizer setting I use with a Sennheiser
MB2 Pro headset:

This is the waveform for this episode before applying the
Compressor.

This is the waveform for this episode after applying the
equalizer discussed earlier, the Compressor at threshold -31dB, noise
floor -40dB and ratio 2:1. No make-up gain at the Compressor. Finally,
Normalize to peak amplitude of -12dB. I was wrong in the show to say
that I had been using "Amplify," in fact I have been using
"Normalize."
