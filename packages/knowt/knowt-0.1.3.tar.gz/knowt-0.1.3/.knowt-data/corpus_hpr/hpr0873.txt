## hpr0873 :: Philip and Rebecca Newborough of CrunchBang

 
Today we interview Philip Newborough (aka corenominal) project lead for CrunchBang Linux and their community manager Rebecca Newborough. CrunchBang is a Debian GNU/Linux based distribution offering a great blend of speed, style and substance. Using the nimble Openbox window manager, it is highly customisable and provides a modern, full-featured GNU/Linux system without sacrificing performance.


In September 2011, Philip gave up paid employment to concentrate on personal projects and is now working full-time on CrunchBang Linux. Feel free to donate a over on his sitehttps://crunchbang.org/donate
