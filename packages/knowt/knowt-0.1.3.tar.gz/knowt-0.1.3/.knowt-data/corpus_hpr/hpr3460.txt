## hpr3460 :: Dodge and Burn

 Layer Modes, sometimes called Blending Modes, allow you to combine layers in a variety of ways. We continue with the Dodge and Burn Modes. Dodge is one of the Lighten Modes, while Burn is one of the Darken Modes, but I pulled them out for their own tutorial because they are not only closely related (inverse of each other), but also because I wanted to cover their use as Tool Modes in addition to Layer Modes. These are the Layer Modes available on the latest (at the time I write this) version of GIMP, 2.10.24.
