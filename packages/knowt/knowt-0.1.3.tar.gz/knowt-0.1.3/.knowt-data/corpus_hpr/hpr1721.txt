## hpr1721 :: Cross-compilers Part 2

 
In part 1 I described cross-compiling, what it means and why you might
want to, or even need to use it.


I also described how to create a cross-compiler tool-chain using crosstool-ng.


In this show I will demonstrate using one of the cross-compilers which
I created as described in the last show to compile a Raspberry Pi Linux kernel.


As usual with my shows the show-notes can't be squashed into 4k, so there is an HTML version at:
