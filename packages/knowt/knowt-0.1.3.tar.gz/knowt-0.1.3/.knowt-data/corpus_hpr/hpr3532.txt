## hpr3532 :: Self-hosting in small scale E0: Disclaimer and general idea

 By the end of the series I would like to end up with an example repository on Github/Gitlab with scenarios and example configuration file which makes them easy to replicate and modify to your need. I am interested in your opinion what type of service would you fancy to self-host yourself. So don't hesitate to contact me on twitter, matrix.org or in email.
