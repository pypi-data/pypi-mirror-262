## hpr3379 :: Linux Inlaws S01E34: The one with the intelligence

 
    In this fourth part of our three-part miniseries on Deep and Machine Learning our two heroes shed some
    light on a DL architecture called Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT), a pretty sophistic piece
    of software that fools most humans when it comes to authoring text (ideal for budding writers with
    a block in place). Other topics of discussion includes OpenAI (the company behind this framework),
    Elon Musk, Bitcoin, Microsoft and if the GPT can actually pass the Turing test. All will be revealed -
