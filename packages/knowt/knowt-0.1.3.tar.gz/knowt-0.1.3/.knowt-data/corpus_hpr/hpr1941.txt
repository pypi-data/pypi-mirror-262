 What's in my case
I'm a fountain pen geek and I thought I'd share my geekiness on HPR in case there are any other FPGeeks out there.
I have a pen case which I bought from China through eBay, and so I felt that this allowed me to add this show to the 'What's in my ...' series.
I have written out a long set of notes to accompany this episode and these are available here https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1941/full_shownotes.html.
