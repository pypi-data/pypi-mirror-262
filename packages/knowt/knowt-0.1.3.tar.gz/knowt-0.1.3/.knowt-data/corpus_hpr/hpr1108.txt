Kit
Description




My Backpack


 My Backpack - note the HPR Badge - this is the bag I take to work every day.




My Acer Aspire netbook


This is a refurbed type unit I got from the Acer Direct.




My Kindle 2


This kindle was a birthday present from Rachel, last year.  She knows me so well :)Its loaded with a load of ebooks from the great folks at O'reilly.The case for this was from Tesco




My Car-pod ipod


When I upgraded cars the biggest disappointment for me was that going from a Kia Cee'd , where I could plug in USB keys with pod-casts on - I now no longer had a USB port in my SEAT.  Rachel bought this for me from CEX.  I've replaced the firmware with rockbox.




My newest iPod


My newest iPod - this used to belong to my Rachel, but the screen has started to go - She looked at getting it repaired - pricey as it is out of the warranty period - so she got herself a new one (cue a long process of me transferring her songs to the new iPod :() and I acquired her old one.  I have replaced the Apple firmware with rockbox, and it works great under Linux.




My 2GB USB Key


This key contains nothing (at the moment) apart from a design for a leaving cake (Keep calm and Google it) and a file called ldlinux.sys, left over from the previous contents.


Google cake






My Conference Folio


This is a pleather folio I picked up ages ago from I know now where - probably before Opal Telecoms was bought by TalkTalk.  Currently the old web address (www.opal.co.uk) seems to redirect to opal-solutions.com which seems to redirect to TalkTalk, only it actually doesn't work.




I keep an Oxford pad (i like the paper) in here.

 My Microsoft mouse was missing from my bag, as I had been using it with my Raspberry Pi - but it's like this.Â
