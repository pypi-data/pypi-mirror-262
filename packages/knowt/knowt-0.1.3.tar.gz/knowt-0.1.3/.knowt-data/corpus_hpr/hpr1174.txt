A few things I forgot to mention in the episode. The muriatic acid/hydrogen peroxide etching solution can be used multiple times. Store it in plastic or glass containers. The tinting fluid can also be reused. But, it will need to be agitated and or slightly heated (place container in a bath of hot water) before reuse as the mix will settle out.
