## hpr1432 :: Fahrenheit 212

 Please consider recording an episode for Hacker Public Radio. We are a you-contribute podcast. :)
Ken requests an episode on Fahrenheit, which really requires discussion of the two temperature systems, and how they are quantified.
Terminology
Centigrade: old fashioned term for Celsius Kelvin (K): less common measurement of temperature used for Science Thermal Equilibrium: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics Absolute zero: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero

My personal preference is Celsius. Less numbers to deal with in everyday use. Really Cold – Temperatures below 0°C Really Hot – Temperatures above 30°C The "American" thinking is temperatures go in 20's, 30's, 40's...etc. more work! Obligatory gun discussion Indirect conversation about PV = nRT formula Correction: the absence of pressure (vacuum) causes water to boil. Celsius and Fahrenheit are "measured" by the states of water boiling/freezing.

Celsius
freezes at 0°
boils at 100°

Fahrenheit
freezes at 32
boils 212°

1 (K) Kelvin = -273.15°C
