## hpr3369 :: Linux Inlaws S01E33: The Return of the Rust

 In this episode - aptly named "The return of the Rust" our two heroes host
a very special guest: no other than Steve Klabnik of Rust fame himself.
Needless to say, this hipster programming language which is on everbody's mind
at the moment (apart maybe from a few lost souls still crying over spilled
coffee) plays a very important role in this show in addition to the newly
founded Rust Foundation hosting such eclectic members such as Microsoft,
Mozilla, Google and Facebook just to name a few looking after the language.
