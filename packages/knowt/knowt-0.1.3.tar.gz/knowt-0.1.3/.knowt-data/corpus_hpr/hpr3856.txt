## hpr3856 :: Painting toy soldiers

 Here are the games I started painting first:


Mysterium: I don't actually like this game, but it nevertheless provided some simple plastic crystal balls that became my first paint experience.


Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu: A great game that ships with 6 hero figures and 3 shogoth figures. Very fun to paint, and I mostly used mostly cheap acrylic paint from the local art store.


Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game: D&D combat game with 40 miniatures of varying sizes and complexity. Really good source of cheap miniatures so you can get lots of painting practise (and you can use the miniatures in your roleplaying games and the board game).


I have no prior experience with paint of any kind, but here are some of the resources I mentioned in the show.


Since recording, I have invested in spray-on primer over the paint-on primer I mention in the episode.


I've been buying mostly Citadel contrast paints because they're readily available in New Zealand from the Warhammer (Games Workshop, in the UK) store.


Speedpaint by The Army Painter are similar but maybe cheaper depending on your region.
