## hpr3866 :: Introducing myself

 Hello, my name is André Jaenisch. You can find myself online under
Ryuno-Ki as well.
This is my first episode on Hacker Public Radio!
It is recorded on 8th May 2023 using Audacity.

Today I want to introduce myself.
I'm a web developer for ten years now and recently turned into a
freelancer.
My area of expertise is with Frontend technologies, although I also know
Node.js and Python. I taught myself these languages because my studies
in mathematics did not cover them.
During my studies I switched to GNU/Linux. I started with Ubuntu but
discovered that I prefer Rolling Release distributions more. So I jumped
to Sabayon Linux which was based on Gentoo back then but pre-compiled
the binaries while staying compatible. Now they decided to turn into
another direction so I was looking for another home. I tried Gecko Linux
based on openSUSE for a while until they had bad news in the press. I'm
currently running Kaisen Linux which is based on Debian Bookworm.
Speaking of, I love to read. I have whole shelves filled with books
here.
There is so much to learn from books even in the age of the Internet. I
enjoy that they have a finite amount of content you can walk
through.
I learned about Hacker Public Radio at FOSDEM 2023. When I mentioned
that I have a RODE NT-USB microphone at home already I was encouraged to
contribute to the show. Now I have been listening to the podcast since
the beginning of the year and already heard some of the emergency shows.
I noticed that the hackers on the show are mainly from the United
States. I hope you welcome people from other parts of the world as
well.
I'm from Germany in Europe. A beautiful place to live and I bet as
diverse as in the States when it comes to the landscape. We have more
than Berlin and Bavaria here!
I'm not quite sure what kind of content you would love to hear about.
I have the requested topics page in front of me and could talk about
different items. For example, my first smartphone ever was a Firefox OS
(I still have it. As well as a tablet).
I switched to Android with F-Droid when Mozilla was cancelling the
project. I'm running on a Fairphone here, which is a small Dutch
manufacturer that already managed to move the whole industry into a more
sustainable direction. Because we produce lots of waste. So I could talk
about that.
Or I could talk about building things for the web. Usually I blog
about that because I feel like text feels more natural to it. But then I
saw that some episodes contained code snippets in the show notes.
I could talk about mathematics. We don't have enough podcasts about
math! My focus was on statistics and numerics so that might be
interesting?
What I would love to hear more about is music theory. You see I
haven't learned to play an instrument in my life. Mainly because those
are expensive. My personal taste goes more into heavy metal but I'm not
sure whether you would call me a fan. What does make a metalhead anyway?
But in order to improve my game development having some sort of music
and sound effects is important. So I was really enjoying the episode
3792 on reading music sheets. I lend some books on the library to learn
more. These subjects weren't covered in depth in my school days!
Another subject I would like to learn more about is electronics.
Especially repairing one's computers. Look, I'm using ThinkPads since
years now. I have a X250 (from FOSDEM) in current use. But I also have a
X200 and a T520 gathering dust here. Mainly because something „broke”
with the hardware and I'm too afraid to crack them open.
Then there's a HP Pavilion standing under my desk to wait for repair.
And even one of the old machines from the DOS era with an original
Lemmings installed! But I have no idea how to refurbish them into a
bootable state. Do you have ideas?
I'm sharing my homepage as well as
my e-mail address in
the show notes. I would really love to hear back from you.
I feel like I already touched on different ideas today, but looking
at the time the recording is rather short. Personally I can tune into
episodes up to 30 minutes best, so I will try to respect this threshold
myself.
