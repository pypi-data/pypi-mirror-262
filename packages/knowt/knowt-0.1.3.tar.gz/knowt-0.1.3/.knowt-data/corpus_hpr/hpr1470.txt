## hpr1470 :: Learn to read time with ccClock

 Over the years the image of the clock has been abstracted and stylized to
a point where a long and a short line inside a circle, or even inside four
dots on the ordinals, can be instantaneously recognized as a clock. This is
perfectly fine if you already know how to read the analog clock but it makes
no sense to use such a design as a teaching aid.




As a teaching device, you need to make sure all the information that has been abstracted away has been put back.
That is the basic principle of the ccClock

The minute hand points at the minute dial
All the minutes are listed removing the need to know the 5 or 15 math table
The Clockwise direction is emphasized with arrows and text orientation.
The two per day rotation of the hour hand is described using a concentric spiral
The progression of day into night is indicated by recognizable icons of the rising and setting sun and moon
The written format is described in the traditional dial digits
The spoken form is described in speech balloonsLinks
