## hpr3850 :: New Mexico 2

 We finished our stay in Anthony with a Saturday trip into Las Cruces
to see the local market and the museums, more hiking, and a trip to see
Native American Petroglyphs. We also went into El Paso to check out the
zoo. It was fine, but we confirmed that we don't really like going into
El Paso. We are not much on driving in big cities any longer,
particularly in a big truck. Then it was time to move on to our next
stop, Presidio, Texas. This is so close to the border that a 5 minute
walk takes you to the Rio Grande.
