 Good day to all in HPR land, this is Tony Hughes coming to you from Blackpool in the UK again. This is a second instalment about some of the software I use on Linux Mint 19.1, on a regular basis. So without further ado lets get on with the show.

USB Image writer
VirtualBox – Virtualisation software to virtualise x86 and AMD64 bit PC’s
OBS – Open Broadcast software
Brasero/XFburn – CD/DVD writing software

So that’s it for this episode. I’ll be back to talk about some of the utilities I use on Mint on another show. This is Tony Hughes signing off for now.
