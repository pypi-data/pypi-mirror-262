## hpr2475 :: Information Underground -- Sex, Drugs, and Rock-n-Roll

 Deepgeek, Klaatu, and Lostnbronx look back at the flappers and speakeasies of the 1920's and 30's, and attempt to draw a line from the newly independent women of that era, up through the Playboy Bunnies of the 1950's, all the way to today.
