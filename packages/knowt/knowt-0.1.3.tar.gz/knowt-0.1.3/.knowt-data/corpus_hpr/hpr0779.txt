Today on HPR we dip into the past and pluck out a gem for our Syndicated Thursday slot.


Taken from https://tenbuckreview.net/2010/episode-13-wargames-2/

Would you like to play a game?  How about a nice game of thermonuclear war?  Strap in as we review a classic movie about hacking and nuclear tensions.
Special Thanks go to Kilroy2.0 for the intro bumper and not hijacking our site for his own purposes yet.  As well as DualCore for the permission to play there track War Games for the closing music.
