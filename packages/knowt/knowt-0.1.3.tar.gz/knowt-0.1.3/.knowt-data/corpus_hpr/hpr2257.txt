## hpr2257 :: Watt OS

 In this short episode I tell you about installing Watt OS onto an Acer Aspire One Netbook from 2008.
This net book came with a 8Gig SSD installed and a 32bit 1.6G atom processor and many modern Linux spins are just too big for the hardware.
However Watt OS came to the rescue and installed on the Netbook without issue.
I plan to give it a go on a Lenovo x61 shortly and will let you know how that works out, my thought is it will fly on that hardware.
