## hpr1664 :: Life and Times of a Geek part 1

 Life and Times of a Geek - part 1
I really liked David Whitman's idea of doing a show on his birthday https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1547, so I'm borrowing the idea.
This show is being released on my 65th birthday, and I decided to use this opportunity to tell you about my long experience with computational devices as part of the series "How I Found Linux". Thinking about what I want to cover, I realise that it might be quite a lot, so I'm organising the shows into a collection of short episodes.
I have been thinking about doing this for a while. Up until now I was concerned that it would be a bit self-indulgent, but I have been advised to just go ahead and do it. I hope you find the shows interesting.
The full notes for this episode are to be found here: https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1664_full_notes.html
