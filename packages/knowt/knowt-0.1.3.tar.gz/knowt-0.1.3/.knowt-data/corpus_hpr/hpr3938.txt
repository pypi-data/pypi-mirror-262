## hpr3938 :: An open directory of web audio stream

the site has good searching features, and even has a player. It has a
map view that's cute but not too useful because it doesn't zoom in
enough. Still fun to fly around the world and tune in simply by clicking
the balloons, you should try it.
Mobile apps that use this directory are found on https://www.radio-browser.info/users.
The ones I've used are TuneFM (with ads, pay what you want (I think) to
remove ads, but very good Android Auto), and Transistor (no Android
Auto, otherwise perfect). Open Radio is pretty good but the Android Auto
is buggy. I have not tried any others.
The episode in which Ken Fallon interviewed one of the maintainers of
Funkwhale was hpr3808.
Some stations I've been listening to:

Radio
MEC: Brazilian state-controlled. Located in Rio de Janeiro. Plays
more uppity stuff.
Radio
Nacional Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian state-controlled, located in Rio
de Janeiro. Plays more popular music, football broadcasts. A good show
comes on every saturday at 11:00 BRT.
Radio
Liga Samba: Samba.
Kansas
City Online Radio: an online-only Blues station. Seems to mostly
syndicate podcasts.
