## hpr3184 :: Linux Inlaws S01E15: IT Security and stick insects

 In this episode Martin discovers that protecting pictures of stick insects (rated XXX or not)
on USB sticks (pun intended) can be an ardous endeavour indeed. Never mind eventually turning
this into a business including web servers, shared file spaces and password storage. Additional
bonus: the lovely Emma from Rainbow Escorts makes another cameo apperance supported by some Irish, um, students.
