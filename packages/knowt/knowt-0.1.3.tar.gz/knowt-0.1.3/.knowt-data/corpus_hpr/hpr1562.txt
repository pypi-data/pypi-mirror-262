These are the places your sdk/ndk/ant goes:


/usr/local/share/android-ndk-r9d
/usr/local/share/android-sdk-linux
/usr/local/share/ant


This is an archive of /usr/local/share/android-sdk-linux/bin, which is the directory you create.

This is what /etc/profile.d/android.sh looks like:


export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/share/ant
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/android-sdk-linux/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin


here's the example app:
https://theadesilva.com/pants.tar.gz
uncompress it and type "make", that produces app.apk to run on your device.
