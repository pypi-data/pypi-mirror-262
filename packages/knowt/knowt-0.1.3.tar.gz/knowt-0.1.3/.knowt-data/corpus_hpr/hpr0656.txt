## hpr0656 :: My first steps in recovering pictures

 
This is my first podcast ever and I show you how easy it is to recover pictures from a dying disk. It's not high-tech as I found out (using the commands anyway).
Links to the used tools and PartedMagic:


Photorec (recover pictures and other files on havily dammaged filesystem)



https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec



Ddrescue {fancy imaging-tool to get data from dammaged media}



https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html



PartedMagic

The switches I used in ddrescue as given in their documentation:


ddrescue -f -n /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 logfile
ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 logfile
