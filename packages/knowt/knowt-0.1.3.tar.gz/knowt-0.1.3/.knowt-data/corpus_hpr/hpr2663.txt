## hpr2663 :: Short review on a 2.5 inch SSD/HDD caddy

 Well Ken made another call for shows and as my recent interview series has come to an end by the time you listen to this here is a short review of a USB3 2.5inch HDD/SSD caddy I got from E-bay a few weeks ago.
As many of you who have listened to my previous ramblings know I frequent a local Computer auction and recently they have had some cheap 128Gig SSD’s for sale and I managed to pick several up at a good price. After using some to upgrade some desktop PC’s to SSD I had a couple of these spare and as I have USB3 on my main laptop thought it would be good to be able to use one or two of these as portable storage or even for boot drives to test out odd Linux distro or 2.
So I purchased a caddy off that font of all things techie E-bay for £5.50, link here:
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/USB-3-0-to-SATA-Hard-Drive-Enclosure-Caddy-Case-For-2-5-Inch-HDD-SSD-External/282930148654?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2648
So after it arrived I plugged in one of the drives and tested it out. The first thing to notice is that SSD’s being 7mm in depth flop about a bit in the case but this is easily resolved by a bit of card under the drive to help it fit snug in the case and it does mean that the case will support the larger 9mm 2.5inch spinners if needed. I’ve not tested a larger older spinner but I suspect they will not fit as 9mm ones are very snug in the case.
Anyway the drive was detected by the PC/Laptop and works flawlessly and as it is so quick to swap drives in the caddy means I can carry large data files and my music and video library when on the move with the advantage that it is less likely to be damaged if accidentally dropped or knocked off a surface, which is quite likely with a portable spinner HDD.
I am very happy with this purchase and it has already become a regular part of my travelling tool kit/laptop bag.
