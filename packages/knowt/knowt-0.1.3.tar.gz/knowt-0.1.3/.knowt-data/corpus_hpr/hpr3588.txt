## hpr3588 :: Linux Inlaws S01E55: Get yer boots on for a fresh look at init systems

 In this episode, Martin and Chris discuss init systems and Chris outs
himself as a systemd fan boy (Devuan followers take note :-). Even Linux and
other FLOSS OS geeks not interested in what happens when you flick the power
switch on a computer may find this episode (vaguely) interesting as some light
is also shed on the philosophy of the different system architectures and their
history (Ever wanted to know what an /360 IPL really is? Then stay tuned...).
