## hpr3278 :: A Minor Victory Against Designed-In Obsolescence

 The Ipad2, at over 9 years old, is unsupported with security or any other kind of updates. Few apps in the App Store will run on its old version of IOS, and that operating system cannot be upgraded.
As far as Apple are concerned an Ipad2 should have been sent to the scrap heap years ago. If you found its 16GB of storage wasn't enough, you were supposed to dump it and buy a new one as you couldn't add more. If you found that you couldn't run the latest version of your favourite apps, dump it and buy a new one as you couldn't upgrade the operating system to the required standard.
Is it necessary to abide by this designed-in obsolescence? Beeza inherits an Ipad2 and decides to find out if he can get any serious use out of it or whether it really does need to be dumped.
