## hpr1940 :: WASHLUG Talk  on LastPass

 
I had the opportunity to present a talk on the LastPass intrusion at our local LUG, the Washtenaw Linux Users Group, which expanded on a previous HPR episode and added some additional material that I think might be of interest to our listeners. I still stand by my claim that LastPass was not seriously affected by the intrusion and is still an excellent security solution for most computer users.
