## hpr0803 :: A novacut support call

 
This is a the "hour call" to Jason DeRose after making a $100 pledge to novacut. https://novacut.com/ @novacut @hpr !hpr


Back in episode 0780, klaatu interviewed Jason DeRose about NovaCut. At the time they were running a kickstarter campaign to raise money to fund the project.
saras fox was one of the contributors and that earned him a hour long conversation which we bring to you today.
