## hpr3419 :: Linux Inlaws S01E38: Tiny kernels

  This episode is dedicated to tiny kernels driving operating systems also
    known as micro-kernels.  While discussing the last 100 years of operating
    system design and implementation, our two aging heroes also shed some
    light on operating systems in general and their recent history (like fifty
    years). Unless you're a true OS nerd, you find the episode mildly
    refreshing and educational on the layers of software underneath your
    beloved applications controlling the hardware and other shenanigans. If
    you're an OS nerd, this episode may have the potential of closing your few
    remaining knowledge gaps (or something like this).  A fun show for
    children of all ages and beyond.
