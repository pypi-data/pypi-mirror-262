## hpr1320 :: How I got into Linux

 
This is my first HPR, first ever podcast, and first ever attempt at editing any audio. Don't expect greatness.
The banging in the background is my daughter playing with something.
I give a very quick rundown of my introduction to Linux, programming, and tech in general.  This is a pretty short show.


I forgot to mention that early on in high school or middle school I enjoyed playing with DOS on an old 386 and that is probably what got my interest and led me to enroll in the High School computer science class that I mention.
I didn't really have anything planned to talk about, I should probably do that next time.
