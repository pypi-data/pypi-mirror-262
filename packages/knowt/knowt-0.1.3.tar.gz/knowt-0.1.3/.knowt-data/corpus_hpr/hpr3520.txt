## hpr3520 :: Inversion Layer Modes

 Layer Modes, sometimes called Blending Modes, allow you to combine layers in a variety of ways. We continue with the Inversion Modes, which in various ways invert the lightness and the color values of the component layers. These are the Layer Modes available on the latest (at the time I write this) version of GIMP, 2.10.24.
