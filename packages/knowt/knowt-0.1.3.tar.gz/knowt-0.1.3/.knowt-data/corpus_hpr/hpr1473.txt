## hpr1473 :: FOSDEM Discussion

 
I decided to attend FOSDEM 2014 this year. I had thought about going
to last year's conference but didn't get organised enough to make it.
When I mentioned my plans to my friend Tom, he thought he'd attend
too, and we agreed to meet up there.


When we got back from the conference I wanted to record a conversation
with Tom about our impressions of the event. We tried to do this four
times before we finally managed it. We struggled through one recorder
battery failure and two Mumble failures before we achieved success.
This is the result of our conversation.


Apologies for the phone interference in the background, I hadn't
realised the recorder (a Tascam DR-07) would pick it up.
