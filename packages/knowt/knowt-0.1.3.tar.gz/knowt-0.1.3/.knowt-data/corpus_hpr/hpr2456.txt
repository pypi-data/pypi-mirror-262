Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This
discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

The threaded discussions this month can be found here:
https://hackerpublicradio.org/pipermail/hpr_hackerpublicradio.org/2017-December/thread.html

Issue Tracker
Josh of AnHonestHost.com has provided HPR with a GitLab repository we use for storing website code and scripts. It includes an issue tracker which we have been using to track some of the recent issues we have been experiencing. We plan to use this more in the future.
See https://gitlab.anhonesthost.com/HPR/HPR_Public_Code/issues.
Hosting for HPR
HPR is hosted by Josh of AnHonestHost.com. We would appreciate it if you could donate to help reduce his costs in funding the hosting.
HPR's shows and audio are also hosted by the Internet Archive (archive.org). They are currently running a funding drive where a generous supporter will match donations 3-to-1. As they say: "Your $5 becomes $20!"
Donations to the Internet Archive would also be appreciated.
HPR shows on the Internet Archive
HPR shows from number 871 up to 2455 are currently available on the Internet Archive as individual "identifiers" in the Archive terminology.
Gradually, earlier shows are being added and the shows for the coming week are added each weekend. The podcast feeds have recently been redirected to download from the copies on archive.org.
In recent months the upload process has been enhanced to make sure that a copy of the notes and all other components of each show (such as pictures, and downloadable files) are available on archive.org as well as on the HPR site. Earlier uploads where this was not the case will be updated in due course.
Static web site
Can anyone recommend static site tools?
