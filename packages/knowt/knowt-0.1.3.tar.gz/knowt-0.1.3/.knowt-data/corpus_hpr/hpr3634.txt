 Everything You Always Wanted to Know About PEX
Part 05– PEX and the Single Installer – My PEX installation experience part 2
Pulling PEX

Much like pulling thick wire

My method

Used fish tape to pull mason's line
Tied mason's line to PEX about 4 inches from end.
Taped above & below with electrical tape
Then tied line again closer to the end of PEX.
Wrapped again with electrical tape

Pull extra
Unroll and let it lay straight for 24 hours if "curve memory" is a problem
Can be challenging and require an individual installer to go back and forth between the feed point and the pull point.

Supporting PEX

1" and smaller PEX must be supported horizontally every 32 inches
Vertically, it must be supported at every floor and midway between floors (every 4-6 feet)

Can be challenging to hold in place until secured
Zip ties are your friend!

Using a manifold

Determine your needs
Number of hot and cold outputs
Valve type

Handled
Wrench/key

Find a location with
Easy access
Fairly central to avoid long delays for hot water
Limited light exposure
Build or buy?
Costs
Appearance
Materials
Securing manifold in place
Anchor securely

Block wall with anchors
To wood for spanning wall studs (I don't know why I kept saying "Joist" during the recording)
Do not anchor to drywall

Insulate from wall if needed

Connecting to the main line

What to replace and what to use
Size matters
Plan to include manifold if needed

Connecting to water heater

Where/how to connect
Pipe Unions?
Protect from heat
Shut-off valve
Expansion tank
Silicon tape or pipe dope

Connecting to endpoints

What to keep and what to replace
Transition connectors
SharkBite
Solder
Thread
Glue

Exterior hose taps

Reuse or replace?
Frost free / anti-siphon
Anchor securely
Help is better!

Turning it on!

If using a manifold turn on one section at a time, from the bottom up
Open sink valves
Ease it on a little at a time
Then increase flow
Turn off sink tap (Slowly) to let pressure build
Keep watching for leaks
Coordinate with a partner and communicate (cell phone?)

Afterwards

Cover any PEX exposed to light
Watch for leaks
Repair holes
Run water daily to flush out bad taste
Inspection?
