## hpr3809 :: The Abominable Post Apocalyptic Podcast Player

 Notes: Forgot to mention that I hot glued the top lid (original lid
for the 'speaker box'), on top of the boards. I had used the device with
the top uncovered for a month because I hoped I would find a better
choice but after getting tired of the wires detaching and worrying about
the sdcard slot getting wrecked I decided to commit to glueing the lid
on.
The boards are very robust, I dropped them in the snow a few times.
They would stop working but after drying off would function.
I didn't find the datasheet with the resistance values for other
values until after I glued the lid so will have to open it up again or
get into one of the switch lines and do resistor combinations... now
that I know more I think I should be able to control the mp3 player with
one analog output pin from the arduino for all the functions, since it
seems the pin 8 that all the switch resistors lead to detects voltage
levels from the voltage divider created when one of the switches goes to
ground.
The robot is using 4 lines right now for mp3 control. Would be cool
if I could free up 3 more but I don't remember if any of them are
occupying an analogue slot.
No power button! None needed. Pause and unpause via momentary switch.
The charger board can charge from micro usb or usb-c and will protect
your 18650 cell from running flat and damaging itself.
