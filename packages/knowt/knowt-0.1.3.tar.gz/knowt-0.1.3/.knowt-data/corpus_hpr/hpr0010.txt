 Linux Boot Process - Part I
SystemV vs BSD Style Scripts

In part one of the Linux Boot Series we take a top level look at the Linux boot process and discuss some of the differences between SystemV based systems and BSD style systems. 
 I focus on RedHat, Slackware, Ubuntu (Debian) and Arch Linux.  Below are some resources for further information.
Redhat - RHL 9 boot - shutdown process 
Slackware Boot Process 
Debian Boot Process 
Basic overview of SystemV vs BSD Systems 
IBM developer works book - Linux Boot Process
Gentoo Handbook for x86 - It's hard to specify one chapter because Gentoo's documentation is top notch and very informative.  Review the installation and initscripts chapters in particular.
