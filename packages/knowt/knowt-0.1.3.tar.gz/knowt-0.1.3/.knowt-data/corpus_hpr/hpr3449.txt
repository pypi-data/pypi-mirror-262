## hpr3449 :: Linux Inlaws S01E41: The Halloween Documents

 In this infomercial on Microsoft, our hosts discuss the infamous Halloween
documents ('tis the season after all), a set of ancient scrolls dating back
more than twenty years and giving an overview of the behemoth's then strategy
on open source and how to possibly combat it. But fear not, ye of little faith
:-), all is well now as the episode shows also the long way Microsoft has come
since then and its adoption (and giving back!) as an enterprise technology.
Plus: How to increase your market cap by using FLOSS. And last but not least:
The Dark Side is back by popular demand!  With a special episode on the usual
Halloween stuff including vampires, Transylvania, politicians, QAnon, Zoom,
Teams and other horror topics (Ever wondered what happened to Angela Merkel
after she stepped down as Germany's chancelorette in 2021? Then don't miss out
on this episode!).
