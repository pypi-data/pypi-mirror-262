## hpr0942 :: Zentyal Linux Small Business Server

 
Today I talked about Zentyal Linux Small Business Server,found at www.zentyal.org. From the website:
"Zentyal can act as a Gateway, Infrastructure Manager, Unified Threat Manager, Office Server, Unified Communication Server or a combination of them. One single, easy-to-use platform to manage all your network services."


Check out their youtube channel!
