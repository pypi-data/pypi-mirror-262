Beni read this article which lead to him trying out Slackware and being very
impressed by its simplicity.


That's why he asked mcnalu to do a HPR episode about Slackware, which is
probably the oldest Linux Distro that's still around and whose developer follows
a no-nonsense strategy and is very conservative when it comes switching to new
stuff that comes up in the Linux world (like PAM or systemd)


The distro is one of the if not the most Unix-like Linux distro. It uses a BSD
style init system instead of widely used sysvinit.


Beni and mcnalu talk about the installation process, finding dokumentation and
why the website is outdated.


Further they discuss the package manager and what it means that it doesn't
resolve dependencies. They also explain why this isn't necessariliy a bad
thing and where to find binary packages.


In the end they talk about where the Slackware community meets and who is in
charge of Slackware.

Slackware documentation isn't as good the BSDs dokumentation or the Arch
Wiki. But it's definitely getting better

and there is also 'Slackware essentials', a book that's also available online:
