## hpr1731 :: Upgrading an old laptop

 
In July of 2010 I was given a laptop to repair by one of my friends, I couldnâ€™t figure out what was wrong with it despite hours of trial and error so eventually I got so frustrated with it that I just set it aside and forgot about for a while. Meanwhile my friend got another laptop so he told me I could keep it.
