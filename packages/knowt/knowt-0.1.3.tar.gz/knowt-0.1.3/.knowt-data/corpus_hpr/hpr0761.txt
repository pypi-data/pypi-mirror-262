Selecting a CMS

Callisto.fm

A Callisto.fm user suggested that you add "Hacker Public Radio" to Callisto.fm!. Unfortunately the terms of service are not compatibel with a Creative Commons lisence.

CMS BACKEND

All three are on par from an accessability point of view.
Each would require additional coding to support the features of HPR 
For now we'll stick with the droops(tm) cms

RFC Changing show to CC-BY-SA

17 hosts have replied and 100% of those that replied gave permission for the change to CC-BY-SA
107 hosts have yet to reply. 
This means that a little over 1/3rd of the shows have been re-licensed. I intend to email them directly as they may not be on the mail list.


Hi All,

This is an official request for a change of license that *NEW* shows
are uploaded as.

The proposal is to change from:
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/

To https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

The RFC will be open for a month and the results will be announced
here and on July's HPR Community News. If approved all shows after
that time will be by default CC-BY-SA unless indicated in the show
notes. Further, I would then contact everyone that has hosted so far
asking if we can relisence their show(s) as CC-BY-SA.

This is entirely up to the community so please use the mail list you
voice your opinion. Even a one liner is fine.

Ken.
