## hpr3341 :: Linux on a serial Terminal - And Jorome's MainFrame Challenge

 Well its bit of challenge for Jerome to teach me how to do a Mainframe on a PI with serial terminal. I started the project using a old HPE 700/96 terminal amber. I used this site as my prime info.

First is seeing if you have a serial port

    dmesg | egrep --color 'serial|ttyS'

Then install getty if its not there
Then add your config line to /etc/gettydefs
Then make work if you reboot.
The do report
Then you have the log in prompt on the terminal
