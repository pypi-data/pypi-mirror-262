another layout picture, note marks on tube

finished product

test fitting assembly one, the engine room

brazing complete! assembly one done

setting up assembly tube, gray tube slips inside the red tube

need to cut that small tab off, get to hear this in the recording

jigging up the frame, similar to john kulps set up, see hpr 1282

still in the jig but all brazed up, top half of frame done!

the next part will be modifiying the rear triangle and brazing it where i’m pointing to.
Summary

all in all, went better than expected, i’ll clean up those brazing joints after the bike is done and has been ridden for a while, before I paint it.
brazing isn’t as difficult as i thought it might be. give it a try its a cool hacker skill!
