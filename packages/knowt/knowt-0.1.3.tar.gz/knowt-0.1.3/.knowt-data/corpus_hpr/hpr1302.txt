## hpr1302 :: How I Got to Linux

 
In this show, I cover my early years learning code in the late 60s. I move on to my history with home computers, and finding out about Linux around 2007 or so. I comment on Ubuntu and Mint. I mention dual booting and my one episode of triple booting.


Listeners, this is my first attempt at a show. It's not that hard, and I would like to hear from others as to how they got to Linux.
