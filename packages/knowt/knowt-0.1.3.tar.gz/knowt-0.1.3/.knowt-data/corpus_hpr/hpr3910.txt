## hpr3910 :: Playing Civilization II

 As I did for the original Civilization, I want to give a few hints on
playing this marvelous upgrade. This is obviously not a complete manual
or strategy guide, which would take a lot longer, but if you
happened to run across a copy and wanted to check it out these are a
some hints on what you might want to do. I do give you links to other
resources if you want to go into more depth.
