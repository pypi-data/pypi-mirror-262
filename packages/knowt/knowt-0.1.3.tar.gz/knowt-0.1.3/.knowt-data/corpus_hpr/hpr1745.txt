## hpr1745 :: 51 - LibreOffice Impress - Overview and Guidance

 
We begin the discussion of Impress, the Presentation Graphics (i.e. slide deck) component of Libre Office. In this episode we look at some of the basic issues around presentations that you need to consider *before* you open up the software. Constructing a good presentation is not easy, and there are some good principles that the masters of the art can impart. WE discuss some of these here and provide links to good resources.
