The Open Smart Grid Platform allows you to monitor and control hardware in the public space. With several (generic) functions ready to use, the main benefits of the Open Smart Grid Platform are: scalability & high availability, high security, its generic design, and no vendor lock-in.

https://www.perl.org/

Perl 5 is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 29 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from portables to mainframes and is suitable for both rapid prototyping and large scale development projects. "Perl" is a family of languages, "Perl 6" is part of the family, but it is a separate language which has its own development team. Its existence has no significant impact on the continuing development of "Perl 5".

https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/

Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a type of a Linux installation and the name of a book written by Gerard Beekmans, among others. The book gives readers instructions on how to build a Linux system from source. Linux From Scratch is a way to install a working Linux system by building all components of it manually. This is a longer process than installing a pre-compiled Linux distribution. The advantages to this method are a compact, flexible and secure system and a greater understanding of the internal workings of the Linux-based operating systems.
