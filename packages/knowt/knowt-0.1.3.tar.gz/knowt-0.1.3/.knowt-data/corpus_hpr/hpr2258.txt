## hpr2258 :: Killer Keilbasa

 I have heard out here a few recipes so I figured I would throw one out here that goes over real well when we make it.
Recipe:

1 Lb. Keilbasa (your choice)
2 TBSP Ketchup
2 TBSP Brown Sugar
2 Table spoons jelly (I have used orange Marmalade, Grape Jelly and various flavors of Jalapeno or pepper jelly)



Crock Pot (Slow cooker) or sauce pan
In crock pot add Kielbasa sliced in 1/2" pieces
Add jelly
Add Brown Sugar
Add Ketchup

Turn crock pot on medium for 2 hours checking and stirring every half hour. Should be ready in 2 hours.
In sauce pan on medium heat stirring continuously until mixture liquefies and the Kielbasa look done. Probably less than 20 minutes this way but you have to watch it or it burns. This is why we use a slow cooker.
I make 5-7 lbs at a time for a party and usually it is all gone by the end of the party. So I take it that it is a hit. This also is pretty good over rice. Almost Asian style.
