## hpr4014 :: Post-Quantum Cryptography Update 1st November 2023

 In May of 2023 a guide was published by NIST that aimed to guide IT
Professionals and Security Officers on steps to take as we move into a
world where Quantum computing has made traditional cryptography and
security measures obsolete. This is their take on a best practices
manual, and if you are in security or are an IT professional it merits a
good look. And it is only 4 pages long, so you can do it easily.
