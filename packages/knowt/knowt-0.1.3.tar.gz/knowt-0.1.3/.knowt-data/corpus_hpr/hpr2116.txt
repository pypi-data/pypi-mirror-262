 Duffer Gardening
In August I was invited on the Duffercast podcast as a guest.
While waiting for all of the participants to arrive, inscius (Mikael) in Sweden, chalkahlom (Gavin) in Hungary and myself in Edinburgh, Scotland, decided to record a show for HPR, since we were using Mumble. Because two of the participants are gardeners we chatted about gardening.
This show is the result.
More about The Duffercast may be found at https://duffercast.org/.
Thanks also to The Bugcast for the use of their Mumble server!
Note: The Calendula that Mikael mentioned is more commonly known as a Marigold https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendula.
