## hpr2418 :: What's in my ham shack, part 2

 

Eurosonic 12V 35 Amp Power Supply, I couldn't find a picture like my power supply instead I found picture of a similar one. My power supply has a light blue casing and is substantially bigger than this as it can supply 12V at 35 amps.

TS940 Service Manual
After recording the show I decided to see if there was a link to the user manual this I found easily. This got me thinking if the service manual was also available and to my surprise it is, all 108 gloriously detailed pages. Feel free to knock yourself out with the detail.
