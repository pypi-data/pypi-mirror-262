## hpr3636 :: The Importance of Data Reduction

 The stuff Evil Steve doesn't want you to know with Lurking Prion. This is Season 1, Episode 7.
In this episode, I have a discussion about data reduction with special guest and author, R. Brady Frost. The discussion revolves around the security risk of keeping too much data available, and things that can be done to mitigate those risks.
