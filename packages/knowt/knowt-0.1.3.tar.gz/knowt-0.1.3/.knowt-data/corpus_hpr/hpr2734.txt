## hpr2734 :: Mashpodder

 After I recorded this episode I had a little look on the HPR site I found that Ken Fallon had already covered mashpodder, no doubt he did a better job than me as this was done in a bit of a rush.
Hopefully somebody will find this of some use

Link to the excellent GNU world order by Klaatu, I think it was this episode that he mentioned the great Chess Griffin from Linux reality. Apologies if this is the wrong episode.
