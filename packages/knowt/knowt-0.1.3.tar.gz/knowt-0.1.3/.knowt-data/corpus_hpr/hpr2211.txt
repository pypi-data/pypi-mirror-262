## hpr2211 :: My podcast workflow

 My podcast workflow
I have been listening to podcasts for many years. I started in 2005, when I bought my first MP3 player.
Various podcast downloaders (or podcatchers) have existed over this time, some of which I have tried. Now I use a script based on Bashpodder, which I have built to meet my needs. I also use a database to hold details of the feeds I subscribe to, what episodes have been downloaded, what is on a player to be listened to and what can be deleted. I have written many scripts (in Bash, Perl and Python) to manage all of this, and I will be describing the overall workflow in this episode without going into too much detail.
I was prompted to put together this show by folky’s HPR episode 1992 “How I’m handling my podcast-subscriptions and -listening”. Thanks to him for a very interesting episode.
