## hpr0923 :: 12 Gazillion Buttons

 
Jezra and NYbill discuss their predictions for 2012 and the things they are looking forward to in the new
year.  The discussion moves on to LUG's.  Jezra takes Bill on a trip down memory lane. Then Bill strikes a nerve with Jez who rants about 3D movies (Language warning).  They finish up talking about their
current hardware and software projects.
