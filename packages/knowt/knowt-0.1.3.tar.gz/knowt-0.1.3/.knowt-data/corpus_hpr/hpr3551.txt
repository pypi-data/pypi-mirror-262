## hpr3551 :: Bash snippet - some possibly helpful hints

 Overview
I write a moderate number of Bash scripts these days. Bash is not a programming language as such, but it’s quite powerful in what it can do by itself, and with other tools it’s capable of many things.
I have enjoyed writing such scripts for many years on a variety of hardware and operating systems, and Bash is my favourite - partly because Linux itself is so flexible.
This is just a short show describing three things I tend to do in Bash scripts to assist with some tasks I find I need to undertake.

Generate Bash variables from a text file - usually output from a program
Fill Bash arrays with data from a file or other source
Use environment variables to control the Bash script’s execution
