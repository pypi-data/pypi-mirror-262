## hpr3069 :: Linux Inlaws S01E05 Porn and Skynet

 Linux Inlaws - a podcast about on topics around free and open source software, any associated contraband, communism / the revolution in general and whatever else fancies your tickle.
Please note that this and other episodes may contain strong language, offensive humor and other certainly not politically correct language - you have been warned (our parents insisted on this disclaimer - happy mum?). Thus the content is not suitable for consumption in the workplace (especially when played back on a speaker in an open plan office or similar environments), any minors under the age of 35 or any pets including fluffy little killer bunnies, your trusty guide dog (unless on speed) and cute t-rexes or other associated dinosaurs.
