## hpr1291 :: Parsing an ISO8601 formatted duration field with Perl

 
Ken recently asked Dave for help with a Perl regular expression for
parsing ISO8601 time durations. As a consequence a Perl script was
written, which is available at
https://gitlab.com/davmo/hprmisc/blob/master/parse_8601_duration.


In this show Ken and Dave discuss this script at some (considerable)
length. Keen listeners might want to view the script as they listen.
Detailed show notes describing how to put together a Perl regular
expression are also available at https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1291/.


Unfortunately some of the line numbers in the script referred to in the
show are now incorrect since Dave could not stop himself updating it.


For detailed show notes on how Dave created the script see:

For a html version of the script see:https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1291/parse_8601_duration.html
