## hpr2055 :: GNU Nano Editor

 I recently heard an HPR Podcast where it was mentioned that Nano was not a real text editor. That somehow VI or Emacs or Kate or Gedit were in some way better than Nano. I just wanted to set the record straight that Nano is a serious editor that has a huge following and a facebook page.
