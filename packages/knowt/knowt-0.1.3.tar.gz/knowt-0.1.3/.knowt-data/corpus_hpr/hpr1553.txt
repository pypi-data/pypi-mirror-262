## hpr1553 :: TuxJam 33.333 - How we got into Linux 

 Kevie and Andrew release TuxJam episode thirty three and a third as an exclusive to HPR on how they got into Linux, interspersed with a few Creative Commons licensed tunes. The story begins in the mid-1990s and some credit is given to a Microsoft product. At no point do they put on terrible Irish accents and discuss the spelling of whisk(e)y*.
