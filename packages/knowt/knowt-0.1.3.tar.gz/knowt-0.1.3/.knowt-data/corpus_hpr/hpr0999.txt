## hpr0999 :: Simon Phipps on Open Software: OGG Camp Part One

 This is the first of our highlights of last Summer's unconference, OGG Camp eleven, held at Farnham Maltings in the South of England.
Introducing Simon Phipps, who presented the opening session of the unconference to a packed main hall, on Software Freedom.
A computer industry veteran, Simon Phipps came on with an actual box of hats which he proceeded the change at speed, reminding me of Tommy Cooper in his heyday.
Simon has come up through hands-on roles as field engineer, programmer and systems analyst, run a software publishing company, worked with OSI standards in the eighties, on the first commercial collaborative conferencing software in the nineties, and helped introduce both Java and XML at IBM.
A founding Director of the Open Mobile Alliance, Simon is Chief Strategy Officer at independent software company ForgeRock and Director of the Open Source Initiative. Find his essays at webmink.com.
