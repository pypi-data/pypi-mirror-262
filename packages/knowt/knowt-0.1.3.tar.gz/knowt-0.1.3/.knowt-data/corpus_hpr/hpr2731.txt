## hpr2731 :: My 8 bit Christmas

 For Christmas 2018 Santa – well, Mrs mcnalu – gave me a BBC Model B which was my first computer back in the early 1980s. This request was heavily implied in TuxJam 70 - Gift for Geeks.
I can highly recommend the seller who, as you will hear, was extremely helpful when this 36 year old bundle of 8 bit loveliness became very poorly on Boxing Day. It came with a Turbo MMC installed and you can see it in action on another BBC Model B in this video.
The noise you hear at the start - the beeeeee BEEP - is the sound of me turning on the BBC. I mention in the show that mode 0 of the Beeb, as it is affectionately known, has 80 columns and 40 rows. This isn’t quite right, there are only 32 rows in mode 0.
