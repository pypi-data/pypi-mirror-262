We will continue to promote new podcasts and other creative commons material but due to a lack of slots, we are only releasing material created exclusively for HPR. If there is a piece of creative commons content that you would like to promote, then feel free to record a regular show where you introduce the content and explain why it is important, providing links to where we can get more information. 


Today I am doing just that. As a member of the HPR community, I would like to bring the podcast LINUX LUDDITES with the tag line "Not all change is progress". Taking their name from "Linux" the an operating system kernel by Linus Torvalds, and "Luddites" from the 19th-century English textile artisans who protested against newly developed labour-saving machinery.


I am submitting Episode 11 as it includes a fascinating interview with Rob Landley, former maintainer of BusyBox and covers among other things his experiences of GPL enforcement. For complete episode show notes see https://linuxluddites.com/shows/episode-11/


If this podcast is not in your feed, you would do very well to add it.


If there is a show is new to the scene, ie not on the linuxlink.net, then contact us about it and also consider submitting an episode as a featured podcast.
