## hpr3074 :: For your consideration - Escape Pod

 
It's high time I submitted a sample episode from Escape Pod, one of the many excellent Podcasts from the Escape Artists. They are a serious platform for the best science fiction out there today.


With so much choice, I can pick a recommendation that I think will be right up HPR's alley, and that is Escape Pod 624: Fandom for Robots released on April 19, 2018 written by Vina Jie-Min Prasad and Narrated by Trendane Sparks.
