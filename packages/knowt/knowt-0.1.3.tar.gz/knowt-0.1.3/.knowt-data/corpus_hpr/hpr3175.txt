## hpr3175 :: International Keyboard

 I decided to use my time spent in relative isolation to do something productive and learn another language. I picked Spanish because I am hoping to visit Mexico and other Latin American countries whenever the plague lifts. I decided to document this for anyone who wants to know what options I found and how they have worked for me so far. This is the third part where I explain how I implemented the US International Keyboard on a variety of platforms. This lets me type characters that Spanish uses which do not appear on a standard US English keyboard. And best of all, it a purely free software fix.
