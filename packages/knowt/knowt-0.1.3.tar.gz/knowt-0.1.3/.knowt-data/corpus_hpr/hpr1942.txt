## hpr1942 :: Kobo Touch N-905 E-Reader

 Klaatu reviews the Kobo Touch N-905 e-reader.
Too Long; Didn't Listen: it's a positive review and the device mostly works well with Linux. There are some exceptions, such as the need to hack around the registration process; luckily, that's easy:

That being "the ugly", here are the Good and the Bad:
Good:

works with Linux, after one initial hack
uses file manager or calibre
great format support (EPUB, EPUB3, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, TIFF, TXT, HTML, RTF, CBZ, CBR)
e-ink 
great battery life (lasts a month on one charge, with every evening and weekend filled with reading)
a little more interactive and configurable than expected
one device, one app, one purpose
small, lightweight, convenient
cheap ($60 USD)
expansion up to 32gb

Negative

requires registration (or a rego hack)
rearranges your books by meta data; no override to respect your dirs
touch screen
slow (though not annoyingly slow)
long time to index books
hard to keep track of books you are currently reading
sleep/off screen should be more configurable
