## hpr0669 :: QSK Netcast 6: The Origin of Open Source

 Originally aired on OCTOBER 15TH, 2010
This episode of the QSK Netcast is the audio recording of my talk at Ohio Linux Fest 2010 entitled “The Origin of Open Source.”  The talk turned into a strange but, I think, interesting melange of Open Source philosophy, history, sociology and religion.  The biggest problem was the poor audio recording equipment used in a very large room so the audio many be difficult to understand in a few places.  I did what I could to clean it up using Audacity, but it’s simply not great.  Hope everyone enjoys it, though.  I’m going to attempt to put up written transcripts of all my episodes starting very soon.
