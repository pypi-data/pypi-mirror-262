## hpr2030 :: Book Review: The Pocket Ref

 Recorded this episode while suffering from some severe seasonal allergies, so please disregard any sniffing, wheezing or coughing that may have crept in.
This is a brief introduction to the Pocket Ref by Thomas Glover. In this episode, I don't go into great depth of the books many topics, primarily due to the nature of the book itself. It is meant to be a reference book, and as such it contains a treasure trove of reference material from a very broad range of topics.
Also, I mention a few other titles in this series - links below.
