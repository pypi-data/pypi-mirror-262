Hacker Public Radio New Year’s Eve Show
Edited from linuxlugcast.com
Hey folks
It’s that time of year again. Time for the Hacker Public Radio 24 hr (26 hr) New Years Eve Show.
For those who don’t know on New Years Eve 2018-12-31 at 10:00 am UTC (5:00 am EST) we will have a recording going on the HPR Mumble server (at ch1.teamspeak.cc on port 64747) for anyone to come on say “Happy New Year” and talk about what ever they want.
We will leave the recording going until 2019-01-01 12:00 am UTC (7:00 am EST) or until the conversation stops.
For those who have never used Mumble before, we have a guide over at linuxlugcast.com in our how to section explaining how to setup the desktop Mumble client, but Mumble isn’t only available for the desktop. It is also available for Android and IOS.
We are also going to setup an etherpad for people to share links to things they are discussing.
So please stop in. Say “Hi” and maybe join in the conversation with other HPR listeners and contributors. It’s always a good time.
New podcast - Libre Lounge
Libre Lounge
Quoted from the site:

Libre Lounge is a podcast where we casually discuss various topics involving user freedom, crossing free software, free culture, network and hosting freedom, and libre hardware designs. We discuss everything from policy and licensing to deep dives on technical topics… whatever seems interesting that week. At some point we might even have guests!

Internet Archive funding drive
As you know, HPR uploads all current episodes to the Internet Archive at https://archive.org, and is in the process of uploading older shows, so we are particularly keen that this amazing service continues.
The Internet Archive is currently fundraising. Donations are currently being matched by a generous supporter, so this will double your impact if you are able to donate.
Tags and Summaries
Over the period tags and/or summaries have been added to 23 shows which were without them.
If you would like to contribute to the tag/summary project visit the summary page at https://hackerpublicradio.org/report_missing_tags.php and follow the instructions there.
