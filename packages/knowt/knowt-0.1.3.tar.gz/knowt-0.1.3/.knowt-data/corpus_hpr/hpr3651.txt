Olly Clark
The UK Tech community has been saddened to hear of the death of Oliver (Olly) Clark, a well known presence at OggCamp, Barcamp and Raspberry Pi meetings. He apparently died in November 2021 as a consequence of COVID-19. His family did not know who to contact in the wider community, so this news only became apparent recently.
