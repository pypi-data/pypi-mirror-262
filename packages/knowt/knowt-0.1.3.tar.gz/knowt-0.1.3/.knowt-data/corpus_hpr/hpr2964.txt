## hpr2964 :: Bolos and Bowties: Neckwear for Nerds

 It's probably because of a non-conformist streak in me, but I've never liked traditional neckties. In fact I never wanted to wear any ties until I got my first bolo tie, which was sufficiently different from everyone else and easy enough to put on that I decided I could wear bolo ties. I've built a collection of about a dozen of these and they always get positive comments, especially the ones made from recycled circuit boards. Recently I've expanded my horizons to include bowties, which have a more formal appearance and the added nerd factor of being difficult to tie for most people. In this episode I talk about my ties.
