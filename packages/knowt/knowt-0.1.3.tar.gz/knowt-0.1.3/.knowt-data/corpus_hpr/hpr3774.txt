From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The Optima Batteries ChumpCar World Series is a series of automotive endurance races held on paved road race courses across North America. The races range in length from 6 to 36 hours. The name is a parody of Champ Car, a defunct open wheel professional racing series. Races are sanctioned throughout the United States, as well as in Canada and Mexico. Teams are encouraged, but not required, to decorate their cars with themes.

Charles please grade my math!: http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1353



I am using dimensional analysis. 
(1.97 miles X 60 seconds X 60 minutes) / (110 seconds lap time X 1 minute X 1 hour) = 64.47 MPH for one lap.
now it's your turn! A slower lap took 120 seconds - how fast was Jonny going?
