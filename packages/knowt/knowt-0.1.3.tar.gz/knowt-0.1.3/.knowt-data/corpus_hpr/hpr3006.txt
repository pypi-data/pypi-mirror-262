Updated: Solved: The audio could use a dac or something nice but this will do. Not (DO NOT PLUG IN THE HARNESS WRONG ORDER OR YOU WILL BLOW AT LEAST 4 FUSES ) I had to swap out 3 in the passenger side and 1 for the rear lights on the IPDM E/R next to the battery in a #@$% spot.
pulled the pins and soldered a audio jack to them and fed it though the AC vent :
pin 1 - G : Satellite radio sound signal LH pin 2 + R : Satellite radio sound signal LH pin 3 - w : Satellite radio sound signal RH pin 4 + b : Satellite radio sound signal RH

NOT SOLVED 08/21/2019 : So I'm sick of this jank setup .. the software is wonky and works about 1/2 the time .. I have to ƒ@#$ with it for about 5-10 min every time I want to use it … WIRELINQ is crap.. and I don't want the 600$ BT mod .. I just want AUX in !! I dont care if CD or SAT is spliced!

NO I'm not using a Apple device ..
NO I'm not going BT because its crap audio ..
NO I'm not using MONO or anything like that (discord) because that's even worse then BT…
NO I'm not using a FM Transmitter because that's just stupid its a 2015 car it should have AUX input ..

maybe I can hack it myself the issue is that the SAT is in the @^ing trunk .. so I would have to find the wires that go to the trunk. I use a long speaker wire with alligator clips on it and a continuity tester (volt meter ) to hunt for it …
