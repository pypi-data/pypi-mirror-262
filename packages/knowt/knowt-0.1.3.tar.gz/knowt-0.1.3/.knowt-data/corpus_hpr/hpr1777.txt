About Magnatune

Magnatune Logo

Magnatune is an American independent record label based in Berkeley, California. It was founded in 2003 by John Buckman.
When first set up music could be bought from Magnatune through a download interface on the website with a "pay what you like" pricing model. Later it was possible to purchase physical CDs and in 2007 complete albums and individual tracks could be bought through Amazon.com.
Magnatune moved to a membership plan in 2008 and in 2010 dropped the CD printing service. The subscription model offers monthly or lifetime membership. Members can download as much as they want, or with a streaming membership can stream as much as they want. Many download formats are available and all music is without DRM.
Magnatune encourages buyers to share up to three copies with friends. All of the tracks downloaded free of charge are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (BY-NC-SA) License.
It's legal to play Magnatune music on a non-commercial podcast without paying collecting society fees to organisations such as ASCAP, BMI or SoundExchange.
