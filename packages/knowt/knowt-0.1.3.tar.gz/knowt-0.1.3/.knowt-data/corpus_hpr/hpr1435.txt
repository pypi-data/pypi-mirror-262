## hpr1435 :: 21 - LibreOffice Writer Frame Properties Completed

 
This is the second of two programs that look at Frame properties in LibreOffice Writer. In the first program we looked at how to size and position Frames. Here we look at other things you can do, such as name your frames for linking, wrap text around frames, set the borders and backgrounds, and even add columns to the frame. This finishes the look at the Properties window and what you can do there.
