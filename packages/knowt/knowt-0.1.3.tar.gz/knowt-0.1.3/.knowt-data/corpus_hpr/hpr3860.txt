## hpr3860 :: Civilization II

 This game is not quite as old, and it did make some changes. But the
same "One-more-turn" addictiveness is still there. I can't tell you many
times I started a game, and the next thing I knew the Sun was coming up
outside my window. I'm too old to do that any more, but if I start
another game of Civ II I will be right back in it.
