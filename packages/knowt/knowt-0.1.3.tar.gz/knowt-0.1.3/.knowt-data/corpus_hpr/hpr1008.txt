## hpr1008 :: Fix the "Sticky Keys" Bug in Minecraft

 
  A quickie episode by Windigo
  that covers a fix for the "Sticky Keys" bug in Minecraft on Linux.


  The "Sticky Keys" bug causes the Minecraft client to act as if a button
  hasn't been released when it has - which causes your character, Steve, to
  suffer some awful consequences as a result (depending on what situation
  you are in when the bug occurs).


  Upgrading the LWJGL libraries/drivers that
  come with Minecraft usually fixes this bug. To upgrade the drivers, do the
  following:



    Download an updated version of the LWJGL libraries
    

LWJGL 2.8.0
        - Not the latest release, but worked great for me
      



    Copy the following files from lwjgl-2.8.0/jar/ in the zip
    file you downloaded to /home/[youruser]/.minecraft/bin/,
    replacing the existing files there:
    
jinput.jar
lwjgl.jar
lwjgl_util.jar



    Copy all of the files from lwjgl-2.8.0/natives/ in the
    zip file you downloaded to
    /home/[youruser]/.minecraft/bin/natives/, again replacing the
    existing files there
  


  If you still encounter issues with the new versions of the libraries, try a
  newer or older version until you find one that works with your system. 2.8.0
  happens to work for my setup (Debian Stable w. Sun Java), but YMMV - your
  Minecraft may vary.
