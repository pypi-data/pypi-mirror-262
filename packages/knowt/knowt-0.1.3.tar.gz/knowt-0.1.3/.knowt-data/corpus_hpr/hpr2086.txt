Mailing List discussions

Policy decisions surrounding HPR are taken by the community as a whole. This discussion takes
place on the Mail List which is open to all
HPR listeners and contributors. The discussions are open and available on the
Gmane
archive.

Editor's Note:
The list of mail threads above date from a time when HPR mailing list
messages were copied to Gmane. At that time the Mailman mailing list software
used to run the list seemed not to be able to archive messages, or possibly
couldn't make them visible. We built lists of threads by reading the Gmane
data and showed them here.
Since then Gmane has failed, and been restored, but the HPR lists have been
lost. However, a later version of Mailman made these messages available as
they should have been, so nothing was actually lost!
The above thread links have been disabled, but the threaded list for the month in question can be seen at:
