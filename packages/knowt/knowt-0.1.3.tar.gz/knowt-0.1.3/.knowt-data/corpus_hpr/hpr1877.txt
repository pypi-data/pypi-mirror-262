## hpr1877 :: Recording HPR on the fly on your Android phone

 This episode was produced entirely on my phone, including upload.
Apologies for the atrocious sound quality and the low volume. Consider it performance art. I know I need to speak closer to the phone next time. There's DroidGain, but I guess it only accepts mp3.
TL;DL: Install Urecord from F-Droid, choose 44.1 kHz, RECORD!
I estimate the total amount of time spent on this episode at:

20 mins – installing apps on two phones
20 mins – evaluate apps on two phones (while cooking!)
6 mins – record episode
10 mins – update HPR user profile
30 mins – write show notes (while having dinner!)
15 mins – figure out how to upload this thing from a phone
?? – upload episode

A large part of the typing time was angle brackets. HATE screen input. I want a modern phone with sliding QWERTY like the good old X10 Mini Pro, or maybe the slightly larger HTC Desire Z. Apparently the market doesn't. :-(
Wow, turns out the difficult part was to upload the file. Had to use a file manager as a "provider" for Firefox to get the "document" from.
