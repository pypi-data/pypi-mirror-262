## hpr1513 :: Stir-Fried Stochasticity: Bio-Boogers

 
This is a show concept I came up with half a decade ago, as the show itself  explains. The journal article may be found as PubMed ID#19323757 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19323757 ) if you want to follow along.


Hopefully the updated time references below for the show-note comments are now correct for this version of it. They should be close, anyway. 


Also, I'm oddly pleased at how inferior the "old" part of today's episode sounds: it means I've actually gotten a lot better at recording and editing.
(It's quite listenable still, I think, it just doesn't sound as good as the newer stuff.)

07:52 I'm pretty sure that the Hasbro corporation, owners of the "Play-Doh(tm)" trademark, don't actually make microfluidizers - it's just an analogy

11:05 Yes, including you...

11:47 Yes, "Fecal Transplants".  Ewwww.

11:53 You're welcome.

12:30 If you're not familiar with this kitchen gadget, a "French Press" is a device for making coffee or tea.  It's A glass cylinder with a fine wire-screen plunger.  I suspect you could "plunge" the ingredients together repeatedly to get a sloppy substitute for the microfluidizer processing.

12:28 Larger volume/surface-area ratio, you see... (The "Album Art" photo is "She Slimed Me", by "Jurveston" on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/131023758/ )
