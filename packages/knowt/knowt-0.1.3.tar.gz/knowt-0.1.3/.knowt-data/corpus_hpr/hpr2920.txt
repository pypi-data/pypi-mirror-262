## hpr2920 :: Better Social Media 03 - MeWe

 MeWe is another platform that was advertised to users left high-and-dry by the closure of Google Plus. It is not federated, but does make strong claims of privacy protection, and is the slickest alternative I have seen to Google Plus. So when Google Plus disappeared, many people moved over to this platform. https://www.zwilnik.com/?page_id=1030
