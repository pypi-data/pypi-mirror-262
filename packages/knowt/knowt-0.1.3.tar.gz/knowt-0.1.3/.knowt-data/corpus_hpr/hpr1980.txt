## hpr1980 :: Fixing An Audio Problem while having a rant

 This podcast details how I solved an audio problem I discovered while trying to record another episode for HPR. I'll hopefully get around to recording my original idea at a later date.
The recording was done in a bit of a hurry and I was a bit flustered so please excuse the fast talking and ranting.
