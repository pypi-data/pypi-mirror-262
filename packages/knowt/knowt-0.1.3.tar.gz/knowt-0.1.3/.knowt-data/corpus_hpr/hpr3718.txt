## hpr3718 :: Making Ansible playbooks to configure Single Sign On for popular open source applications

 This is a recording of a short introduction into my latest
project.
To help sysadmins everywhere the Onestein organization (an
organization specialized in Odoo implementations) invested 4 month of
research to create a set of easy to use Ansible playbooks to configure
single sign on (SSO) for popular open source applications to enable them
to authenticate to a Keycloak server as the central identity
provider.
These playbooks have been published on https://github.com/onesteinbv/project_single_sign_on.
The list of supported applications are currently:

Bitwarden
Jenkins
Gitlab
Keycloak (not SSO, but the identity provider)
Nextcloud
Odoo
Xwiki
Zabbix

All playbooks and servers are for Ubuntu servers and are meant to be
used as a starting point.
