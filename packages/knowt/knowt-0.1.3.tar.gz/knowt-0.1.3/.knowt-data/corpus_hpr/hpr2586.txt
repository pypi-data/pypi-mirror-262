Mailing List discussions

discussion takes place on the Mail List which is open to all HPR listeners and
contributors. The discussions are open and available on the HPR server under
Mailman.

Workflow changes
There has been a change to the HPR workflow this month:

Earlier in 2018 a change was made to the database to add an additional version of the host name. This is intended to be spoken by espeak and can hold an alternative spelling which espeak handles better in the audio preamble of shows. In this way the name 'thelovebug', for example, which espeak renders as "Thel Ove Bug" can be stored as 'TheLoveBug', which espeak pronounces correctly.
The use of this field has now been incorporated into the workflow.
Many of these "espeak names" were changed in the database, but we probably haven't catered for them all. If your name is being mispronounced by espeak let us know and we'll try and fix it.
