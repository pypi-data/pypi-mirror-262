Reason for forking the Audacity project
Motivation
Our project initially started as a fork of Audacity as a result of multiple controversies and public relation crises, which you can find out more about here:

Privacy policy which may violate the original project's GPL license
Contributor's License Agreement (CLA) which may violate the same GPL license
Attempts at adding telemetry using Google services for data collection

Nevertheless, the goal of this project is to pick up what the original developers of Audacity the decades-long work by the original creators of Audacity and create an audio editor that is fresh, more modern, convenient and practical to use, with the help and the guidance of our users and our community.
