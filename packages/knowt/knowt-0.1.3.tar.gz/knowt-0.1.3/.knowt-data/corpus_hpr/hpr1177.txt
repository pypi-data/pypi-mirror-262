klaatu https://radio.pittsburgharts.org:8000, dosman is running a part15 radio station at my house. While most people agree with the explicit tag, Ken strongly disagreed with the suggestion.

Reminder of how HPR is governed

While Stankdwag pays for the hosting, HPR is run by the community, not the Admins! That means what the community decides is the direction we take it. 

Filtering "Clean" shows

The necessary changes to accommodate a per show explicit field has been made. 
To get the filtered feeds, please append 'explicit=0' to the end of any of the fields. 
This will trigger the field 'rss/channel/item/itunes:explicit="Clean"'


https://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_mp3_rss.php?explicit=0
https://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_ogg_rss.php?explicit=0
https://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_spx_rss.php?explicit=0
https://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_total_rss.php?explicit=0
https://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_total_ogg_rss.php?explicit=0
https://hackerpublicradio.org/hpr_total_spx_rss.php?explicit=0

This will leave the <itunes:explicit> on the <channel> as "Yes" but will
toggle the <item> to <itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit>.
Currently the only shows flagged as 'explicit=0' are the ones from
klaatu. For those wishing to reclassify your shows please review the
attached guidelines from the FCC and follow the link to Apples website
https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html. Apple has a policy of
banning incorrectly flagged shows, so we could loose approximately 7 -
20 % of HPR listeners in one fell swoop if you classify your show
incorrectly.

Please alert me or admin@hackerpublicradio.org if anything strange
starts to happen.

Ken (as HPR Admin)

Sonar Fundraiser

The Sonar Project is to build a Linux operating system focused on accessibility. There are 1 billion people in the world with some type of disability. Jonathan Nadeau is a blind user and has already made the Sonar GNU/Linux distribution completely accessible to blind people. Now he needs our help to take it to the next level.
