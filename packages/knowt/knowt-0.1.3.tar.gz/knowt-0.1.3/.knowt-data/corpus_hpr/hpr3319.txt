## hpr3319 :: Linux Inlaws S01E28: Politicians and artificial intelligence part 1

 In this episode, our two heroes explore the realm of artificial intelligence, paying special attention to deep learning (hoping that some
of the stuff may rub on them :-). In this first part of a three-part mini-series the chaps discuss the foundation including networks, neurons
and other topics of advanced black magic, carefully avoiding the temptations of introducing too much maths (we'll leave this to the Grumpy Old Coders :-).
