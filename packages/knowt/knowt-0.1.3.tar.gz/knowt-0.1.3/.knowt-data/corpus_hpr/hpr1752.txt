## hpr1752 :: Penguicon 2015 Promo

 
Penguicon 2015 is a combined technology and sicence fiction convention in Southfield, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, and will present over 350 hours of programming over the entire weekend. Of this, around 100 hours are open source, tech-related. In this episode I try to cover the coming attractions of the weekend and maybe entice some people to come join us. It will be a great weekend.
