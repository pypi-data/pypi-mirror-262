## hpr3073 :: Matchbox and Diecast Restoration

 
Today's show is about my recently started hobby of restoring Matchbox models. I talked about this on the New Year show and Ken said it deserved a show in its own right.


So today I briefly talk about how I got into the hobby through watching YouTube Videos of Marty's Matchbox Makeovers, and my first restoration pictured below. Enjoy.
