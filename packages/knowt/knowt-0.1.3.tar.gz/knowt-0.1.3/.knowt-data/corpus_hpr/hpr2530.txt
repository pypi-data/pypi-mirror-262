## hpr2530 :: Introduction to Health

 On our refrigerator we have a note card that says "If you don't take care of your body, where will you live?" This is a very pertinent question that can open up a discussion of how to achieve a better level of health and age gracefully. This show will kick off a series that will explore various topics in how to get good medical information and improve your health.
