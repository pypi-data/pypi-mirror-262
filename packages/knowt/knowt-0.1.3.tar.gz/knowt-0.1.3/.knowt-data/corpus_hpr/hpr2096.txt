 Useful Bash functions - part 2
Overview
This is the second show about Bash functions. In this one I revisit the yes_no function from the last episode and deal with some of the deficiencies of that version.
As before it would be interesting to receive feedback on these versions of the function and would be great if other Bash users contributed ideas of their own.
Full Notes
Since the notes explaining this subject are long, they have been placed here.
