## hpr1756 :: Ranger File Manager

 From Man Page:

DESCRIPTION ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings. It provides a minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy. The secondary task of ranger is to figure out which program you want to use to open your files with.
This manual mainly contains information on the usage of ranger. Refer to the README for install instructions and to doc/HACKING for development specific information. For configuration, see the files in ranger/config. They are usually installed to /etc/ranger/config and can be obtained with ranger's --copy-config option.
Inside ranger, you can press 1? for a list of key bindings, 2? for a list of commands and 3? for a list of settings.


Project page: https://ranger.nongnu.org/. Has pretty good documentation
Available on Debian, Arch, Probably others, git and mailing list available as well.
