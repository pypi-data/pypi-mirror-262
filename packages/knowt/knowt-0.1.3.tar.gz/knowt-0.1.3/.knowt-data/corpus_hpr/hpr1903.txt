 Some further Bash tips
Expansion
There are seven types of expansion applied to the command line in the following order:

Brace expansion (we looked at this subject in the last episode 1884)
Tilde expansion
Parameter and variable expansion (this was covered in episode 1648)
Command substitution
Arithmetic expansion
Word splitting
Pathname expansion

We will look at some more of these in this episode but since there is a lot to cover, we'll continue in a later episode.
I have written out a moderately long set of notes about this subject and these are available here https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1903_full_shownotes.html.
