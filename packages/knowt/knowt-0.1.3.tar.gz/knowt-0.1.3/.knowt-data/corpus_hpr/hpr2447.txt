## hpr2447 :: Server Basics 104 OpenVPN Server

 In this episode, Klaatu demonstrates how to:



Install OpenVPN


Generate certificates for your OpenVPN server


Generate a private key for your OpenVPN server


Configure the /etc/openvpn/server.conf file


Start the OpenVPN daemon


In case it is not clear, you can follow along with Klaatu, using the exact same options and configuration values as he is using for a successful install. You do not need to change
In the next episode, he will demonstrate how to do all of the above for OpenVPN clients.

VPN is a big topic that warrants a whole miniseries unto itself, so this and the next episode concentrate on getting a VPN up and running, with clients connected and pinging back to the server on a dedicated subnet. Additional config options based on your specific use-case are left for you to explore on your own.
