Dude man has us wondering what "1 inch below is worth 2 above" 
"its connected with cutting hay... when your using a scythe which is really advanced tech and basicly led to the masive dependance on grain consumption believe it or not. But when cutting grass for hay for winter feed... cutting lower at the bottom by 1 inch gave bigger return for your effort and quality than have the grass 2 inches tailer
