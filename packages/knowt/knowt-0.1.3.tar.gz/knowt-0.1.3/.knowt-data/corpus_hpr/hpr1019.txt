Today we're going to play the audio from a Ted presentation


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
TED (Technology, Education and Design) is a global set of conferences owned by the private non-profit Sapling Foundation, formed to disseminate "ideas worth spreading."


The title of the talk is "The 8 Billion Dollar iPod" and the speaker is Rob Reid who is a humor author and the founder of the company that created the music subscription service Rhapsody.

Todays HPR presentation is an enhanced podcast, where we describe any slides that are not explained in the narrative.


This would be a good time to remind you that Jonathan Nadeau is looking for donations for The Accessible Computing Foundation.
The Accessible Computing Foundation exists to design Free software to help bridge the gap between accessibility and technology. As a nonprofit we will hire developers to create Free accessible software and bring awareness to people's accessible needs around the world.
