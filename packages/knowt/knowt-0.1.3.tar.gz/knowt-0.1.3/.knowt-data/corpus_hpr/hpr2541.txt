## hpr2541 :: Microphone Wind Screen Demo

 This is just a quick demo of my new microphone wind screen muff. Though you can still hear some wind noise getting through when especially sharp gusts roll by, I think you'll agree the difference with and without the screen is dramatic.
The Movo is not perfect, and will not stop all wind noise on a very blustery day, but this kind of screen is essential for outdoor recording. The only editing I did on this track was a fade-in and out, and transcoding it from wav to flac (which was then transcoded at HPR into other formats).
