# FastANPR
A fast automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) library. This package employs YOLOv8, a lightweight model, for detection, and Paddle OCR, a lightweight *optical character recognition* (OCR) library.

## Installation
```bash
pip install fastanpr
```

## Usage
```python
import cv2
import asyncio

from fastanpr import FastANPR

# To use cuda, replace 'cpu' with 'cuda' or device id, e.g., '0'. Default is set to 'cpu'.
fast_anpr = FastANPR(device='cpu')

async def show_anpr_result(file: str) -> None:
    image = cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread(file), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    anpr_result = await fast_anpr.run(image)
    print(anpr_result)

files = [...]
_ = await asyncio.gather(*[show_anpr_result(file) for file in files])
```
