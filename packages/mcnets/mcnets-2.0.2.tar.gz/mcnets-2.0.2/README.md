# Monte-Carlo-Neural-Nets

## Overview
Originally a hobby project, this package now represents neural network models that train using a Monte-Carlo algorithm and are on par
with other models such as the MLPRegressor in SciKit-Learn.

Currently in V2.0.0, the list of avaliable models is only the primary NeuralNetwork class. In future updates, there will be additional
models that are built on top of this base, or are revised classes from the previous main version 1.5.0.

Some primary features include:
- Neural Network model with full customization support
- Various built-in activation functions (with support for external ones)
- Built-in test-train-split (TTSplit) and cross-validation (cross_val) functions
- Built-in scorer functions with support for external functions
- Ability to save and load models at any point
