    Parameters
    ----------
    report : pandas_profiling.ProfileReport
        The profile report instance to display.
    height : int or None
        Report height. If set to None, report will take full height, but
        navbar will be disabled. Defaults to None.
    navbar : boolean
        Show navbar if height is fixed.
    key : str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.
