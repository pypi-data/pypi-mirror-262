Main Objectives:

GPT--
1. Add support for other API features, like speech to text recognition
2. Handle key management better, specifically checking the environment key, maybe setting it, and see if there is a way to validate a key (so the manager only stores VALID keys)
2b. Maybe add encryption to the keys file as an option
3. Add more base profiles
4. Add a demonstration for the package, though it would need an API key to run.  Maybe a transcript instead?
5. Add testing scripts to ensure proper functionality
6. Expand on existing profiles to increase accuracy and make them stay on task better

Other Generative AI systems:

Gemini (formerly bard)?
-Available python package, probably GPT needs refactoring to bring common functionality to the parent class
-Might have to write the API caller myself to add to this package
-Requires more investigation

Llama 2?
-Not really investigated yet.
-Again might have to write the API caller myself

Claude:
-More investigation needed
-Good chatbot candidate

OTHER:
--Add github integration for Pypi
--Improve documentation of functions for better software maintenance
