Thread related convenience classes and functions.

*Latest release 20240316*:
Fixed release upload artifacts.

## Class `AdjustableSemaphore`

A semaphore whose value may be tuned after instantiation.

## Function `bg(func, daemon=None, name=None, no_start=False, no_logexc=False, thread_class=None, thread_states=None, args=None, kwargs=None)`

Dispatch the callable `func` in its own `Thread`;
return the `Thread`.

Parameters:
* `func`: a callable for the `Thread` target.
* `daemon`: optional argument specifying the `.daemon` attribute.
* `name`: optional argument specifying the `Thread` name,
  default: the name of `func`.
* `no_logexc`: if false (default `False`), wrap `func` in `@logexc`.
* `no_start`: optional argument, default `False`.
  If true, do not start the `Thread`.
* `thread_class`: the `Thread` factory, default `HasThreadState.Thread`
* `thread_states`: passed tothe  `thread_class` factory
* `args`, `kwargs`: passed to the `Thread` constructor

## Class `HasThreadState(cs.context.ContextManagerMixin)`

A mixin for classes with a `cs.threads.ThreadState` instance as `.state`
providing a context manager which pushes `current=self` onto that state
and a `default()` class method returning `cls.perthread_state.current`
as the default instance of that class.

*NOTE*: the documentation here refers to `cls.perthread_state`, but in
fact we honour the `cls.THREAD_STATE_ATTR` attribute to name
the state attribute which allows perclass state attributes,
and also use with classes which already use `.perthread_state` for
another purpose.

*NOTE*: `HasThreadState.Thread` is a _class_ method whose default
is to push state for all active `HasThreadState` subclasses.
Contrast with `HasThreadState.bg` which is an _instance_method
whose default is to push state for just that instance.
The top level `cs.threads.bg` function calls `HasThreadState.Thread`
to obtain its `Thread`.

## Function `joinif(T: threading.Thread)`

Call `T.join()` if `T` is not the current `Thread`.

Unlike `threading.Thread.join`, this function is a no-op if
`T` is the current `Thread.

The use case is situations such as the shutdown phase of the
`MultiOpenMixin.startup_shutdown` context manager. Because
the "initial open" startup phase is not necessarily run in
the same thread as the "final close" shutdown phase, it is
possible for example for a worker `Thread` to execute the
shutdown phase and try to join itself. Using this function
allows that scenario.

## Class `LockableMixin`

Trite mixin to control access to an object via its `._lock` attribute.
Exposes the `._lock` as the property `.lock`.
Presents a context manager interface for obtaining an object's lock.

## Function `locked(*da, **dkw)`

A decorator for instance methods that must run within a lock.

Decorator keyword arguments:
* `initial_timeout`:
  the initial lock attempt timeout;
  if this is `>0` and exceeded a warning is issued
  and then an indefinite attempt is made.
  Default: `2.0`s
* `lockattr`:
  the name of the attribute of `self`
  which references the lock object.
  Default `'_lock'`

## Function `locked_property(*da, **dkw)`

A thread safe property whose value is cached.
The lock is taken if the value needs to computed.

The default lock attribute is `._lock`.
The default attribute for the cached value is `._`*funcname*
where *funcname* is `func.__name__`.
The default "unset" value for the cache is `None`.

## Function `monitor(*da, **dkw)`

Turn a class into a monitor, all of whose public methods are `@locked`.

This is a simple approach which requires class instances to have a
`._lock` which is an `RLock` or compatible
because methods may naively call each other.

Parameters:
* `attrs`: optional iterable of attribute names to wrap in `@locked`.
  If omitted, all names commencing with a letter are chosen.
* `initial_timeout`: optional initial lock timeout, default `10.0`s.
* `lockattr`: optional lock attribute name, default `'_lock'`.

Only attributes satifying `inspect.ismethod` are wrapped
because `@locked` requires access to the instance `._lock` attribute.

## Class `PriorityLock`

A priority based mutex which is acquired by and released to waiters
in priority order.

The initialiser sets a default priority, itself defaulting to `0`.

The `acquire()` method accepts an optional `priority` value
which specifies the priority of the acquire request;
lower values have higher priorities.
`acquire` returns a new `PriorityLockSubLock`.

Note that internally this allocates a `threading.Lock` per acquirer.

When `acquire` is called, if the `PriorityLock` is taken
then the acquirer blocks on their personal `Lock`.

When `release()` is called the highest priority `Lock` is released.

Within a priority level `acquire`s are served in FIFO order.

Used as a context manager, the mutex is obtained at the default priority.
The `priority()` method offers a context manager
with a specified priority.
Both context managers return the `PriorityLockSubLock`
allocated by the `acquire`.

*Method `PriorityLock.__init__(self, default_priority=0, name=None)`*:
Initialise the `PriorityLock`.

Parameters:
* `default_priority`: the default `acquire` priority,
  default `0`.
* `name`: optional identifying name

## Class `PriorityLockSubLock(PriorityLockSubLock, builtins.tuple)`

The record for the per-`acquire`r `Lock` held by `PriorityLock.acquire`.

## Class `State(_thread._local)`

A `Thread` local object with attributes
which can be used as a context manager to stack attribute values.

Example:

    from cs.threads import ThreadState

    S = ThreadState(verbose=False)

    with S(verbose=True) as prev_attrs:
        if S.verbose:
            print("verbose! (formerly verbose=%s)" % prev_attrs['verbose'])

*Method `State.__init__(self, **kw)`*:
Initiale the `ThreadState`, providing the per-Thread initial values.

## Class `ThreadState(_thread._local)`

A `Thread` local object with attributes
which can be used as a context manager to stack attribute values.

Example:

    from cs.threads import ThreadState

    S = ThreadState(verbose=False)

    with S(verbose=True) as prev_attrs:
        if S.verbose:
            print("verbose! (formerly verbose=%s)" % prev_attrs['verbose'])

*Method `ThreadState.__init__(self, **kw)`*:
Initiale the `ThreadState`, providing the per-Thread initial values.

## Function `via(cmanager, func, *a, **kw)`

Return a callable that calls the supplied `func` inside a
with statement using the context manager `cmanager`.
This intended use case is aimed at deferred function calls.

# Release Log

* Rename State to ThreadState, which how I always use it anyway, and leave a compatibility name behind.
* New joinif(Thread) method to join a Thread unless we are that Thread - this is because MultiOpenMixin.startup_shutdown stuff may run the shutdown in a differ Thread from that which ran the startup.
