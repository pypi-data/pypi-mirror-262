Nanshang data is collected during the Nashang project from 2018 to 2019. The main drilling performed 
is engineering drillings for controlling the soil settlement and quality. Besides, some 
hydrogeological drillings were also performed. Indeed, Nanshang project aim goal is to forecast the 
the probable land subsidence from 2024 to 2035 using many other influencal factors that encompass the
InSAR data, the highways map, the distance to read, rivers ( Pearl rives etc ).
