v0.1.9 (March 20, 2023)
--------------------------

This is a  change performed from ``v0.1.8``.  

- |Fix| Bug fix for absolute path to :term:`Bagoue region` pickling data. We used the ``importlib`` 
  module to handle the path to the pickled data. 
  
- |Fix| Fix bug in updating :term:`tensor` in ``_zupdate`` class of module :mod:`watex.methods.em`. Set the `z` property attribute 
  using the `_z`. Idem for `z_err` which henceforth uses `_z_err` in :class:`watex.externals.z.Z`  module. 

- |Enhancement| Fix the dependencies when using ``scikit-learn >=1.2.1``. Data was new pickled in version ``1.2.1``. No more longer 
  uses the ``1.1.2`` version . Update to ``>=1.2.1`` to avoid the pickle warning at the beginning of package initialization as:
  
  .. code-block:: default 
     
      UserWarning: Trying to unpickle estimator FeatureUnion from version 1.1.2 when using version 1.2.2. This might lead to breaking code or invalid results. Use at your own risk. For more info please refer to:
      https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html#security-maintainability-limitations
      warnings.warn(

  The following changes are made in the ``setup.py``
 
  .. code-block:: python 

    setup_kwargs['install_requires'] = [    
    ... 
    "numpy >=1.23.0",
    "xgboost >=1.7.3", # rather than  >=1.5.0
    "joblib >=1.1.1", # rather than  >=1.2.0
    "scikit-learn >=1.2.1", # rather than ==1.1.2"
    "threadpoolctl >=2.2.0", # rather than ==3.1.0
    "matplotlib ==3.5.3",
    ]
  
- |Fix| In :func:`watex.utils.gistools.convert_position_float2str` fix the bug related to the use of ``type(position) is float`` 
  in the validation of the position value( expected to be a float). ``type (position)`` is replaced by ``isinstance (position, float)``. 

- |Fix| Bug fix in :meth:`watex.view.TPlot.plot_rhoa` when ``errorbar`` parameter is set to ``False``. No more crash , apparent resistivity plot 
  could henceforth be possible either with ``errorbar=True`` or ``False``.
