v0.1.0 (September 12, 2021)
----------------------------

This is the sketch/beginning of the project that implemented the :term:`case-history in Bagoue-region`. At this 
time of project, it wasn't expect to be a library. It was just a toolbox for solving a specific task as a lever/pilot 
initiative to test the capability of using the :term:`machine learning` with the available data to solve the water scarcity problem 
occured in :term:`Bagoue region`. 

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- |Feature| Upload the first commit of the project that implemented the scripts to handle the case history problem. 

- |Feature| Developed :class:`watex.cases.BaseSteps` for processing the data at once.  Additionally, the default organization 
  and scaling with different figure sizes has been improved.

- |Feature| Added the ``feature_transformation`` option to :mod:`watex.transformers` to automate the data transformation using 
  :class:`watex.transformers.StratifiedWithCategoryAdder`.

- |Feature| Added the ability to seed the random number generator for the bootstrap used to define error bars in several plots especially 
  in ``MetricPlot`` which was renamed to :class:`watex.view.EvalPlot` in the ``v0.1.3`` release and :class:`watex.view.QuickPlot`. 

- |Feature| Improved support for grouping observations based on pandas index information in categorical features plots. Should be auto-discarded 
  using the powerfull function :func:`watex.utils.to_numeric_dtypes`. The later automates the data types conversion and outputs either 
  the numerical, categorical features or both.

- |Enhancement| Test the :term:`flow-rate` prediction using the support vector machines algorithmns from the defined DC-features.
