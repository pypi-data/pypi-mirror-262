# EM :mod:`~watex.methods.em`
# ============================
# The EM module is related to a few meter exploration in the case of groundwater 
# exploration. The module provides some basic EMAP steps for EMAP data filtering
# and removing noises. Commonly the method mostly used in groundwater 
# exploration is the audio-magnetotelluric because of the shortest frequency 
# and rapid executions. Furthermore, we can also list some other advantages 
# such as:  
#  
# * is useful for imaging both deep geologic structure and near-surface geology and can provide significant details. 
# * includes a backpack portable system that allows for use in difficult terrain. 
# * the technique requires no high-voltage electrodes, and logistics are 
#   relatively easy to support in the field. Stations can be acquired almost 
#   anywhere and can be placed any distance apart. This allows for large-scale 
#   regional reconnaissance exploration or detailed surveys of local geology 
#   and has no environmental impact 
#
# :note: For deep implementation or exploring a large scale of EM/AMT data  
#     EMAP, it is recommended to use the package `pycsamt <https://github.com/WEgeophysics/watex/>`_. 
#     Create EM object as a collection of EDI-file. 
#     Collect edi-files and create an EM object. It sets he properties from 
#     audio-magnetotelluric. The two(2) components XY and YX will be set and 
#     calculated.Can read MT data instead, however, the full handling transfer 
#     function like Tipper and Spectra is not completed. Use other MT software for a long period's data.

# Mixture Learning Strategy (MXS)   
# ------------------------------- 
# The use of machine learning for k-parameter prediction seems an alternative
# way to reduce the cost of data collection thereby saving money. However, 
# the borehole data comes with a lot of missing k  since the parameter is 
# strongly tied to the aquifer after the pumping test. In other words, the 
# k-parameter collection is feasible if the layer in the well is an aquifer. 
# Unfortunately, predicting some samples of k in a large set of missing data 
# remains an issue using the classical supervised learning methods. We, 
# therefore, propose an alternative approach called a mixture of learning 
# strategy (MXS) to solve these double issues. It entails predicting upstream 
# a na√Øve group of aquifers (NGA) combined with the real values k to 
# counterbalance the missing values and yield an optimal prediction score. 
# The method, first, implies the K-Means and Hierarchical Agglomerative 
# Clustering (HAC) algorithms. K-Means and HAC are used for NGA label 
# predicting necessary for the MXS label merging. 

hdata = load_hlogs ().frame 
# drop the 'remark' columns since there is no valid data 
hdata.drop (columns ='remark', inplace =True)
mxs = MXS (kname ='k').fit(hdata)
# predict the default NGA 
mxs.predictNGA() # default prediction with n_groups =3 
# make MXS labels using the default 'k' categorization 
ymxs=mxs.makeyMXS(categorize_k=True, default_func=True)
print(mxs.yNGA_ [62:74] ) 

print(ymxs[62:74])  
# array([ 1, 22, 22, 22,  3,  1, 22,  1, 22, 22,  1, 22]) 
# to get the label similarity , need to provide the 
# the column name of the aquifer group and fit again like 
mxs = MXS (kname ='k', aqname ='aquifer_group').fit(hdata)
sim = mxs.labelSimilarity() 
print(sim ) 
# [(0, 'II')] # group II and label 0 are very similar
#%%
# Once the MXS label is created, you can use the supervised training 
# strategy for training models. Refer to the model modules (:mod:`~watex.models`)
