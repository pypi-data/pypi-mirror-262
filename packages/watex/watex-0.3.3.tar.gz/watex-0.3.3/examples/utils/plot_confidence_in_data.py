# The default tensor for evaluating the data confidence is the resistivity 
# at TE mode ('xy'). 
#
# Check confidence in the data before starting the concrete processing 
# seems meaningful. In the area with complex terrain, with high topography 
# addition to interference noises, signals are weals or missing 
# especially when using :term:`AMT` survey. The most common technique to 
# do this is to eliminate the bad frequency and interpolate the remains one. 
# However, the tricks for eliminating frequency differ from one author 
# to another. Here, the tip using the data confidence seems meaningful
# to indicate which frequencies to eliminate (at which stations/sites)
# and which ones are still recoverable using the tensor recovering 
# strategy (:meth:`~watex.methods.Processing.zrestore`)  
#
# The plot implements three levels of confidence: 
#   
# - High confidence: :math:`conf. \geq 0.95` values greater than 95% 
# - Soft confidence: :math:`0.5 \leq conf. < 0.95`. The data in this 
#   confidence range can be beneficial for tensor recovery to restore 
#   the weak and missing signals. 
# - bad confidence: :math:`conf. <0.5`. Data in this interval must be 
#   deleted.
# In the following, we used 25 samples of :term:`EDI` data from a locality 
# where :term:`AMT` data is collected with strong interference noises.  
# %% 
# * Plot confidence in two-dimensional view
# Two-dimensional view is ensured by the parameter ``view`` set to ``2d``.
