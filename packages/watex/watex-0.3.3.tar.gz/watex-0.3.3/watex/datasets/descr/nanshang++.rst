Nanshang land subsidence ( LS) data is collected during the Nashang project from June 2015 to december 2022.  Data is collected via 
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar ( InSAR ) and preprocessed to fit the LS. A short report about each year is given below: 
- From June 2015 to the end of 2015, there was no obvious deformation signal in Nansha District, the maximum cumulative settlement 
  reached 21mm, and the overall surface and buildings were relatively stable.
- From June 2015 to the end of 2016, there were large deformations at Shazui East Road, Hengli Town, 
  Nansha District, the southeast side of Dagang Township, and the vicinity of the wharf on the southeast side of Longxue 
  Street, with a maximum cumulative settlement of 64 mm. Combined with satellite optical images and vector maps, it is speculated that 
  the subsidence signal may be caused by groundwater pumping and man-made construction activities.
- From June 2015 to the end of 2017, the deformation signal was the most obvious on the southeast side of Longxue 
  Street, and the maximum cumulative settlement reached 128mm.
- From June 2015 to the end of 2018, the maximum cumulative settlement in Nansha District reached 176mm.
- From June 2015 to the end of 2019, the maximum cumulative settlement in Nansha District reached 225mm.
- From June 2015 to the end of 2020, the deformation signal on the west side of Wanqingsha Town (near Honglian Road) was 
  relatively obvious, and the maximum cumulative settlement reached 263mm. Based on relevant data, it is speculated that the 
  settlement may be caused by the construction activities of the Honglian Bridge Signal.
- From June 2015 to the end of 2021, Xinlian No. 1 Village and Xinlian No. 2 Village of Dagang Town monitored a large area of 
  deformation signals, and the maximum cumulative settlement reached 320mm. Combined with historical optical images, it is speculated 
  that it may be due to man-made construction activities in the village The resulting settling signal.
- From June 2015 to the end of 2022, the maximum cumulative settlement reached 364mm.
