Parameters 
-----------
as_frame : bool, default=False
    If True, the data is a pandas DataFrame including columns with
    appropriate types (numeric). The target is
    a panda DataFrame or Series depending on the number of target columns.
    If `as_frame` is False, then returning a :class:`~watex.utils.Boxspace`
    dictionary-like object, with the following attributes:
    
    - data : {{ndarray, dataframe}} of shape {shape}
        The data matrix. If `as_frame=True`, `data` will be a pandas
        DataFrame.
    - resistivity: {{array-like}} of shape ({shape[0]},)
        The resistivity of the sounding point. 
    - MN: {{array-like}} of shape ({shape[0]},)
        The step value of potential electrodes increasing in meters  
    - AB: {{array-like}} of shape ({shape[0]},)
        The step value of current electrodes increasing in meters  
    - feature_names: list
        The names of the dataset columns.
        .. versionadded:: 0.23
    - DESCR: str
        The full description of the dataset.
    - filename: str
        The path to the location of the data.
        .. versionadded:: 0.20
    .. versionadded:: 0.1.2
    
index_rhoa: int, default=0 
    index of the resistivy columns to retrieve. Note that this is useful in the 
    cases many sounding values are collected in the same survey area. 
    `index_rhoa=0` fetches the first sounding values in the collection of all values. 
    
tag, data_names: None, 
    Always None for API consistency
    
kws: dict, 
    Keywords arguments pass to :func:`~watex.utils.coreutils._is_readable` 
    function for parsing data. 
    
Returns 
--------
data : :class:`~watex.utils.Boxspace`
    Dictionary-like object, with the following attributes.
    - data : {{ndarray, dataframe}} 
        The data matrix. If ``as_frame=True``, `data` will be a pandas DataFrame.

Notes
------
The array configuration is Schlumberger and the max depth investigation is 
{max_depth} meters for :math:`AB/2` (current electrodes). The sounding steps
:math:`AB` starts from {c_start} to {c_stop} meters whereas :math:`MN/2` 
(potential electrodes) starts from {p_start} to {p_stop} meters. 
The total number of sounding performers in {sounding_number} with the prefix '`SE`'.
AB, AB is in meters and SE are in ohm. meters as apparent resistivity values. 
Use the param ``index_rho`` to get the ranking of the sounding resistivity value. 
For instance ``index_rhoa=0`` fetch the first array of resistivity values (SE1).

Notes
------
The array configuration is Schlumberger and the max depth investigation is 
{max_depth} meters for :math:`AB/2` (current electrodes). The  profiling step
:math:`AB` is fixed to {AB_distance}  meters whereas :math:`MN/2`  also fixed to
(potential electrodes) to {MN_distance}meters. The total number of station data 
collected is {profiling_number}.
`station`, `easting`, and `northing` are in meters and `rho` columns are 
in ohm. meters as apparent resistivity values.  
Furthermore, if the UTM coordinate (easting and northing) data is given as well 
as the UTM_zone, the latitude and longitude data are auto-computed and 
vice versa. The user does need to provide both coordinates data types
( UTM or DD:MM.SS)

kname: str, int
    Name of permeability coefficient columns. `kname` allows to retrieve the 
    permeability coefficient 'k' in  a specific dataframe. If integer is passed, 
    it assumes the index of the dataframe  fits the 'k' columns. Note that 
    integer value must not be out the dataframe size along axis 1. Commonly
   `kname` needs to be supplied when a dataframe is passed as a positional 
    or keyword argument. 
    """,

k: array-like 1d, pandas.Series 
    Array of permeability coefficient 'k' or a pandas series that contains the 
    'k' values. Two  dimensional array or more is not allowed. However,
    when `k` passes as a dataframe and `kname` is not supplied, an error 
    raises since `kname` is used to retrieve `k` values from the dataframe 
    and overwritten it.

    target="""
target: Array-like or :class:`pd.Series`
    Is the dependent variable in supervised (and semisupervised) learning, 
    passed as `y` to an estimator's fit method. Also known as dependent 
    variable, outcome variable, response variable, ground truth or label. 
    `Scikit-learn`_ works with targets that have minimal structure: a class 
    from a finite set, a finite real-valued number, multiple classes, or 
    multiple numbers. Refer to `Scikit-learn`_ `target types`_ . Note that 
    throughout this library, a `target` is considered as a `pd.Series` where 
    the name is `tname` and the variable `y` i.e `target = tname + y`.

    """,
    model="""
model: callable, always as a function,    
    A model estimator. An object which manages the estimation and decoding 
    of a model. The model is estimated as a deterministic function of:
        * parameters provided in object construction or with set_params;
        * the global numpy.random random state if the estimator’s random_state 
            parameter is set to None; and
        * any data or sample properties passed to the most recent call to fit, 
            fit_transform or fit_predict, or data similarly passed in a sequence 
            of calls to partial_fit.
    The estimated model is stored in public and private attributes on the 
    estimator instance, facilitating decoding through prediction and 
    transformation methods.
    Estimators must provide a fit method, and should provide `set_params` and 
    `get_params`, although these are usually provided by inheritance from 
    `base.BaseEstimator`.
    The core functionality of some estimators may also be available as a ``function``.
    """,
    clf="""
clf :callable, always as a function, classifier estimator
    A supervised (or semi-supervised) predictor with a finite set of discrete 
    possible output values. A classifier supports modeling some of binary, 
    multiclass, multilabel, or multiclass multioutput targets. Within scikit-learn, 
    all classifiers support multi-class classification, defaulting to using a 
    one-vs-rest strategy over the binary classification problem.
    Classifiers must store a classes_ attribute after fitting, and usually 
    inherit from base.ClassifierMixin, which sets their _estimator_type attribute.
    A classifier can be distinguished from other estimators with is_classifier.
    It must implement::
        * fit
        * predict
        * score
    It may also be appropriate to implement decision_function, predict_proba 
    and predict_log_proba.

reg: callable, always as a function
    A regression estimator; Estimators must provide a fit method, and should 
    provide `set_params` and 
    `get_params`, although these are usually provided by inheritance from 
    `base.BaseEstimator`. The estimated model is stored in public and private

    cv="""
cv: float,    
    A cross validation splitting strategy. It used in cross-validation based 
    routines. cv is also available in estimators such as multioutput. 
    ClassifierChain or calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV which use the 
    predictions of one estimator as training data for another, to not overfit 
    the training supervision.
    Possible inputs for cv are usually::
        * An integer, specifying the number of folds in K-fold cross validation. 
            K-fold will be stratified over classes if the estimator is a classifier
            (determined by base.is_classifier) and the targets may represent a 
            binary or multiclass (but not multioutput) classification problem 
            (determined by utils.multiclass.type_of_target).
        * A cross-validation splitter instance. Refer to the User Guide for 
            splitters available within `Scikit-learn`_
        * An iterable yielding train/test splits.
    With some exceptions (especially where not using cross validation at all 
                          is an option), the default is ``4-fold``.

    scoring="""
scoring: str, 
    Specifies the score function to be maximized (usually by :ref:`cross
    validation <cross_validation>`), or -- in some cases -- multiple score
    functions to be reported. The score function can be a string accepted
    by :func:`sklearn.metrics.get_scorer` or a callable :term:`scorer`, not to 
    be confused with an :term:`evaluation metric`, as the latter have a more
    diverse API.  ``scoring`` may also be set to None, in which case the
    estimator's :term:`score` method is used.  See `slearn.scoring_parameter`

test_size : float or int, default=None
    If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion

    be set to 0.25.    
    """, 
    n_jobs="""
n_jobs: int, 
    is used to specify how many concurrent processes or threads should be 
    used for routines that are parallelized with joblib. It specifies the maximum 
    number of concurrently running workers. If 1 is given, no joblib parallelism 
    is used at all, which is useful for debugging. If set to -1, all CPUs are 
    used. For instance::
        * `n_jobs` below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. 
        
        * `n_jobs`=-2, all CPUs but one are used. 
        * `n_jobs` is None by default, which means unset; it will generally be 
            interpreted as n_jobs=1 unless the current joblib.Parallel backend 
            context specifies otherwise.

    Note that even if n_jobs=1, low-level parallelism (via Numpy and OpenMP) 
    might be used in some configuration.
