    # # content: str = "Compared to drugs and even food, cosmetics have been the regulatory stepchild in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) since its adoption in 1938 - until now. At the end of 2022, Congress enacted legislation to mandate that cosmetic product manufacturers and processors take certain actions that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has encouraged them to take for years but for which it had no enforcement authority. Cosmetic producers beware: Increased regulation is coming by the end of 2023. Get ready now.\n\nThe Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (MoCRA) was tucked into the omnibus appropriations bill passed at the end of December. MoCRA appears as Subtitle E of Title II of Division H of the 1,653-page Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Public Law 117-328 (Dec. 29, 2022), beginning at section 3501.\n\nThe passage of MoCRA as part of the omnibus illustrates how difficult it has been to enact legislation to strengthen FDA's authority over cosmetics. Since at least 2010, multiple Congresses have considered, but not enacted, cosmetic regulation bills. Legislation similar to MoCRA was introduced in 2017, 2019, and 2021. None passed, partly because of disputes between large and small cosmetic producers, and between the industry and NGOs.\n\nNow, however, Congress has enacted MoCRA, legislation that reflects numerous compromises. Most provisions take effect one year from enactment, or by December 29, 2023. The new labeling requirement becomes effective one year later on December 29, 2024. (MoCRA § 3503(b))\n\nMoCRA is mainly concerned with cosmetic products, a term defined to mean \"a preparation of cosmetic ingredients with a qualitatively and quantitatively set composition for use in a finished product.\" (FFDCA § 604(2)) In other words, a \"cosmetic product\" has been formulated but not necessarily packaged for retail sale. The term does not include chemicals intended for use in a cosmetic product. However, cosmetic ingredient suppliers can expect their customers to ask for help in compliance with some provisions.\n\nSome MoCRA provisions apply to cosmetic product facilities. \"Facility\" refers to an establishment that manufactures or processes cosmetic products distributed in the U.S., including foreign establishments. (FFDCA § 604(3))\n\nIn brief, MoCRA amends the FFDCA to add several new provisions:\n\nIn short, both FDA and cosmetic product manufacturers and processors have a lot of work to do. We understand that FDA is working on MoCRA implementation, but it has not yet commented on MoCRA on its website.\n\nAdverse event reporting (AER) is an early warning system for potential public health issues associated with using FDA-regulated products. It also serves as a mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in FDA-regulated products that supports FDA efforts to target limited inspection resources to protect public health. Until now, FDA's authority to require AER has been limited to prescription and non-prescription drugs, medical devices, biologics, dietary supplements, and food. With MoCRA, add cosmetics to that list.\n\nFDA has a voluntary AER system for cosmetics. MedWatch allows health care professionals and consumers to submit reports to FDA regarding problems with FDA-regulated products, including cosmetics. It also allows cosmetic user facilities, importers, and manufacturers to report using Form FDA 3500A.\n\nFFDCA § 605 only mandates reporting of a serious adverse event. That term is defined to mean an adverse event (i.e., any adverse health-related event associated with use of a cosmetic) that results in death, life-threatening experience, in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, an infection, serious disfigurement, or requires a medical or surgical intervention to prevent such an outcome. (FFDCA § 604(1), (5)) The reporting obligation would apply to any \"responsible party,\" including the manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose name appears on the cosmetic product's label. (FFDCA §§ 604(4), 605(a))\n\nCosmetic product manufacturers and distributors may want to familiarize themselves with the MedWatch system, as the new system may be similar.\n\nFDA has good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations for other products it regulates. Without statutory authority to require GMPs for cosmetics, FDA has instead provided voluntary cosmetic product GMP guidance (2013, although still a draft).\n\nFFDCA § 606 directs FDA to adopt mandatory GMP regulations for cosmetic products, with simplified requirements for smaller businesses. The regulations are to be generally consistent with national and international standards. Since the FDA voluntary GMP guidance is brief, cosmetic product manufacturers, processors, and distributors may want to review ISO 22715:2006, Cosmetics - Packaging and labelling (last reviewed and confirmed in 2022). This international standard has provisions on personnel, premises, raw materials, packaging materials, production, finished products, quality control laboratory, dealing with out-of-specification results, complaints, recalls, change control, internal audits, and documentation.\n\nFDA must publish its proposed regulations by December 29, 2024, and its final regulations by December 29, 2025.\n\nFFDCA § 607(a) requires the owners and operators of existing cosmetic product facilities in the U.S. or that distribute to the U.S. to register with FDA by December 29, 2023. New facilities must be registered within 60 days of startup. Registrations will need to be renewed every two years, with changes to registration information to be reported within 60 days of the change. Registration will have significance since FDA can suspend a registration if it determines that the cosmetic products manufactured or processed at the facility may cause serious health consequences or death. A suspension would preclude the distribution of cosmetic products from that facility. (FFDCA § 607(f))\n\nSince 1974, FDA has promoted a Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program. (21 C.F.R. Part 710) As the mandatory registration program is likely to be similar to the voluntary one, owners and operators of cosmetic product facilities in the U.S. or that distribute into the U.S. may want to review Part 710 and consider submitting Form FDA 2511 to register their facilities, if they have not already done so.\n\nFFDCA § 607(c) requires the responsible person for each cosmetic product currently marketed in the U.S. to list that product with FDA by December 29, 2023. New cosmetic products must be listed within 120 days of being marketed. Updated information must be submitted annually. Among other information, a product listing must include a list of ingredients, including fragrances, flavors, or colors, as provided in 21 C.F.R. § 701.3.\n\nFDA's Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program includes voluntary product listing, referred to as voluntary filing of cosmetic product ingredient composition statements. (21 C.F.R. Part 720) As the mandatory product listing program is likely to be similar to the voluntary one, responsible persons may want to review Part 720 and consider submitting Form FDA 2512 for their cosmetic products if they have not already done so.\n\nFDA regulations currently require safety substantiation:\n\nEach ingredient used in a cosmetic product and each finished cosmetic product shall be adequately substantiated for safety prior to marketing. Any such ingredient or product whose safety is not adequately substantiated prior to marketing is misbranded unless it contains the following conspicuous statement on the principal display panel: \"Warning - The safety of this product has not been determined.\"\n\n21 C.F.R. § 740.10(a). FFDCA § 608 will bolster that requirement.\n\nIt requires the responsible person for a cosmetic product to ensure adequate substantiation of the product's safety, and to maintain records supporting that substantiation. \"Adequate substantiation of safety\" refers to tests, studies, research, or other information that is considered, among qualified experts, to be sufficient to support a reasonable certainty that a cosmetic product is safe. (FFDCA § 606(c)(1)) \"Safe\" means that the cosmetic product, including its ingredients, is not injurious to users under label conditions or customary or usual conditions. (FFDCA § 606(c)(2)) Cosmetic ingredient suppliers may expect requests from cosmetic product manufacturers for substantiation of the safety of their ingredients.\n\nThe FFDCA § 608 safety substantiation requirement takes effect on December 29, 2023. (MoCRA § 3503(b)(1)) Before that date, responsible persons should confirm that they have documentation to support that their cosmetic products have adequate substantiations of safety.\n\nFDA already has some labeling requirements for cosmetic products, 21 C.F.R. Part 701, and cosmetics labeling guidance. FFDCA § 609 supplements those requirements and that guidance. Labels meeting the new requirements are required for cosmetic products marketed on or after December 29, 2024. (MoCRA § 3503(b)(2))\n\nThe new label must:\n\nThe Factory Inspection authority of FFDCA § 704 extends to cosmetic product facilities. MoCRA § 3504 amended FFDCA § 704 to specify that inspections \"shall\" cover records and other information related to serious adverse event reporting, GMPs, and records covered by FFDCA § 610.\n\nFFDCA § 610 authorizes FDA to have access to all records related to cosmetic products and their ingredients which it reasonably believes may be adulterated to present a threat of serious adverse consequences or death.\n\nThis records access provision does not extend to recipes or formulas for cosmetics, financial data, pricing data, or personnel data (other than with respect to their qualifications), research data (other than safety substantiation data), or sales data (other than shipment data).\n\nWith FFDCA § 611, FDA now has recall authority for cosmetic products which it reasonably determines may be adulterated (including due to noncompliance with the new GMP or safety substantiation requirements) or misbranded (including due to noncompliance with the new labeling requirements). (MoCRA § 3503(a)(2), (3))\n\nThe provision lays out several procedural protections, including the requirement that FDA provide an opportunity for a voluntary recall.\n\nUnder FFDCA § 612, with some exceptions, small businesses (those with gross annual sales less than $1 million (adjusted for inflation)) are not subject to the GMP or facility registration and product listing requirements.\n\nUnder FFDCA § 613, cosmetic products that are also drugs are exempt from most MoCRA requirements. Facilities that manufacture or process cosmetic products subject to drug requirements are also exempt.\n\nMoCRA adds a new express preemption provision, FFDCA § 614(a). In general, no state or locality may impose any requirement for cosmetics regarding registration and product listing, GMPs, records, recalls, adverse event reporting, or safety substantiation that is not identical to the federal requirement.\n\nImportant exclusions from this preemption provision in FFDCA § 614(b) include state requirements:\n\nThis preemption provision does not affect the provision on preemption of requirements for labeling or packaging cosmetics in FFDCA § 752.\n\nSome cosmetics contain talc, and talc may potentially contain asbestos. FDA reports annual results from testing cosmetic products containing talc to see if they also contain asbestos.\n\nMoCRA § 3505 directs FDA to adopt regulations on standardized testing methods for detecting and identifying asbestos in talc-containing cosmetic products. The proposed rule is due by December 29, 2023. The final rule is due 180 days later.\n\nThe FDA website confirms that, \"PFAS are used as ingredients in certain cosmetics, such as lotions, cleansers, nail polish, shaving cream, and some types of makeup, such as lipstick, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and mascara.\"\n\nMoCRA § 3507 directs FDA to issue a report assessing the safety of using PFAS in cosmetic products. The report is due by December 29, 2025.\n\nAn FDA policy statement on animal testing says that \"animal testing by manufacturers seeking to market new products may be used to establish product safety\" after consideration of alternatives.\n\nMoCRA § 3507 conveys the sense of the Congress that:\n\nanimal testing should not be used for the purposes of safety testing on cosmetic products and should be phased out with the exception of appropriate allowances.\n\nThis provision does not bind FDA or manufacturers or processors of cosmetic products."

At the same time, we prepared the ground for next-generation products and platforms like VAN.EA and MB.OS. to keep Mercedes-Benz at the forefront of the industry.\"\n\nOla Kaellenius, Chief Executive Officer of Mercedes-Benz Group AG.\n\n*The figures in this document are preliminary and have neither been approved yet by the Supervisory Board nor audited by the external auditor.\n\nMercedes-Benz Group\n\nQ4 2023\n\nQ4 2022\n\nChange\n\n23/22\n\nFY\n\n2023\n\nFY\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n23/22\n\nRevenue*\n\n40,261\n\n41,003\n\n-1.8%\n\n153,218\n\n150,017\n\n+2.1%\n\nEarnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)*\n\n4,326\n\n5,411\n\n-20.1%\n\n19,660\n\n20,458\n\n-3.9%\n\nEarnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) adjusted*\n\n4,456\n\n5,071\n\n-12.1%\n\n20,004\n\n20,655\n\n-3.2%\n\nNet profit/loss*\n\n3,160\n\n4,027\n\n-21.5%\n\n14,531\n\n14,809\n\n-1.9%\n\nFree Cash Flow (industrial business) *\n\n3,442\n\n2,479\n\n+38.8%\n\n11,316\n\n8,128\n\n+39.2%\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) in EUR\n\n2.99\n\n3.72\n\n-19.7%\n\n13.46\n\n13.55\n\n-0.7%\n\n*in millions of €\n\nInvestments, Free Cash Flow and Net Liquidity\n\nThe Free Cash Flow of the Industrial Business reached €11.3 billion (2022: €8.1 billion) mainly due to high profitability, a high cash conversion rate and lower working capital. The Net Liquidity of the Industrial Business rose to €31.7 billion (end of 2022: €26.6 billion). Group investments in property, plant and equipment in the full year totaled €3.7 billion (2022: €3.5 billion). Research & Development expenditure amounted to €10.0 billion (2022: €8.5 billion).\n\nTransformation\n\nMercedes-Benz gained certification for its SAE Level 3 conditionally automated driving system for use on freeways in Nevada and California and received permission to test its L3 systems on highways in Beijing. These innovations come ahead of the introduction of its operating system MB.OS which will be launched with the new Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture (MMA) which sets new efficiency benchmarks. Mercedes-Benz started its rollout of a dedicated high-power charging network, with sites opening in China, the U.S. and Germany. The company also continued expanding its direct sales model including most recently in Thailand. Direct sales is now live in 11 markets and covers more than 50% of sales in Europe and more than 30% in the Overseas region.\n\nDivisional results\n\nThe adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes at Mercedes-Benz Cars reached €14.3 billion (2022: €16.2 billion) and the adjusted Return on Sales resulted in a solid 12.6% (2022: 14.6%). Hereby, tailwinds from net pricing, lower raw material prices and improved manufacturing costs were outweighed by higher inflation charges and supply-chain related costs.\n\nResearch and Development costs rose for future platforms and technologies, particularly for MB.OS. Net pricing increased significantly with the average sales price up 2% to €74,200 in 2023 and remained positive on a healthy level also in the fourth quarter.\n\nOverall sales volumes remained flat, reaching 2,044,100 units in 2023 and included a sales increase for Mercedes-Maybach (+19%), G-Class (+11%) and Mercedes-AMG (+4%). The model mix remained flat, but on a high level, with Top-End vehicle sales reaching 328,300 last year. The S-Class remains the undisputed leader in its segment, retaining its market share with around 50% in all key regions. Battery electric vehicles now account for 12% of overall Mercedes-Benz Cars sales with Mercedes-Benz reaching the highest share of EV's among all traditional foreign OEMs in the United States in 2023.\n\nThe adjusted Cash Flow Before Interest and Taxes (CFBIT) of Mercedes-Benz Cars increased by 10% to €12.5 billion in 2023 (2022: €11.4 billion) due to improved working capital, resulting in a favorable adjusted Cash Conversion Rate of 0.9 compared to 0.7 last year.\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars (including smart)\n\nQ4 2023\n\nQ4 2022\n\nChange\n\n23/22\n\nFY\n\n2023\n\nFY\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n23/22\n\nSales in units\n\n514,258\n\n536,181\n\n-4.1%\n\n2,044,051\n\n2,040,719\n\n+0.2%\n\n- thereof xEV\n\n112,043\n\n111,046\n\n+0.9%\n\n401,943\n\n333,490\n\n+20.5%\n\n- thereof BEV\n\n66,197\n\n53,539\n\n+23.6%\n\n240,668\n\n149,227\n\n+61.3%\n\nRevenue*\n\n29,569\n\n30,557\n\n-3.2%\n\n112,756\n\n111,601\n\n+1.0%\n\nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)*\n\n2,912\n\n4,243\n\n-31.4%\n\n14,224\n\n16,340\n\n-12.9%\n\nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) adjusted*\n\n2,970\n\n4,088\n\n-27.3%\n\n14,252\n\n16,245\n\n-12.3%\n\nReturn on Sales (RoS) in %\n\n9.8\n\n13.9\n\n-4.1%pts\n\n12.6\n\n14.6\n\n-2.0%pts\n\nReturn on Sales (RoS) adjusted in %\n\n10.0\n\n13.4\n\n-3.4%pts\n\n12.6\n\n14.6\n\n-2.0%pts\n\nCash Flow Before Interest and Taxes (CFBIT)*\n\n3,438\n\n3,104\n\n+10.8%\n\n12,336\n\n10,718\n\n+15.1%\n\nCash Flow Before Interest and Taxes (CFBIT) adjusted*\n\n3,478\n\n3,233\n\n+7.6%\n\n12,535\n\n11,413\n\n+9.8%\n\nCash Conversion Rate adjusted\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n-\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n\n-\n\n*in millions of €\n\nRevenue at Mercedes-Benz Vans rose by 18% to €20.3 billion (2022: €17.2 billion) and adjusted EBIT increased 59% to €3.1 billion (2022: €1.9 billion) year-on-year, as unit sales improved 8% to a record 447,800 units (2022: 415,300 units).\n\nThe strong financial performance is a result of strong product substance, a healthy price premium and product mix, robust net pricing and lower raw material costs. These factors, combined with efficiency measures, helped to offset higher inflation-related and logistic costs. In line with the value growth strategy to focus on premium segments, large Vans dominated sales, resulting in record sales in the U.S., the Sprinter leading its segment in Europe and Mercedes-Benz Vans leading the market in Germany. With 237,400 large, 178,900 mid-size and 31,500 small vans sold, Mercedes-Benz Vans achieved its best annual result to date in each segment.\n\nIn the United States, sales grew by 13% to an annual record of 75,100 units. With around 22,700 eVans, sales of electric vans increased by 51% in 2023, accounting for 5% of total sales. Last year also saw the premiere of the new eSprinter and the facelift of the mid-size van portfolio. With the eCitan, EQT (WLTP: combined electricity consumption 100 kWh/km: 20,7-19,3; combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km), eVito, eVito Tourer, EQV and eSprinter, Mercedes-Benz Vans offers each model also as an all-electric version since 2023. Research and development costs increased due to an investment focus on Van Electric Architecture (VAN.EA). Investments into property, plants and equipment rose as plants were retooled to build the new eSprinter and the facelift of the mid-size vans and to build the all-new generation of electric vans. Full year the adjusted cash flow surged by 48% to €3.0 billion (2022: €2.0 billion), resulting in a strong adjusted Cash Conversation Rate of 1.0 (2022: 1.1).\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans\n\nQ4 2023\n\nQ4 2022\n\nChange\n\n23/22\n\nFY\n\n2023\n\nFY\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n23/22\n\nSales in units\n\n124,317\n\n122,733\n\n+1.3%\n\n447,790\n\n415,344\n\n+7.8%\n\nRevenue*\n\n5,611\n\n5,114\n\n+9.7%\n\n20,288\n\n17,217\n\n+17.8%\n\nEarnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)*\n\n855\n\n670\n\n+27.6%\n\n3,138\n\n1,897\n\n+65.4%\n\nEarnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) adjusted*\n\n809\n\n501\n\n+61.5%\n\n3,063\n\n1,927\n\n+59.0%\n\nReturn on Sales (RoS) in %\n\n15.2\n\n13.1\n\n+2.1%pts\n\n15.5\n\n11.0\n\n+4.5%pts\n\nReturn on Sales (RoS) adjusted in %\n\n14.4\n\n9.8\n\n+4.6%pts\n\n15.1\n\n11.2\n\n+3.9%pts\n\nCash Flow Before Interest and Taxes (CFBIT)*\n\n650\n\n665\n\n-2.3%\n\n2,817\n\n1,731\n\n+62.7%\n\nCash Flow Before Interest and Taxes (CFBIT) adjusted*\n\n714\n\n741\n\n-3.6%\n\n3,018\n\n2,040\n\n+47.9%\n\nCash Conversion Rate adjusted\n\n0.9\n\n1.5\n\n-\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n-\n\n*in millions of €\n\nMercedes-Benz Mobility saw new business increase by 7% to €62.0 billion (2022: €58.0 billion) in a competitive market environment with above average penetration rates for financed or leased electric vehicles. The total portfolio grew in 2023 to €135.0 billion (2022: €132.4 billion). Performance was impacted by a lower portfolio margin due to higher refinancing rates and intensified competition in the financial services sector, resulting in adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes of €1.7 billion (2022: €2.4 billion). The expenses for the establishment of charging activities also had an effect on EBIT. The charging business continued its global ramp up with high-power charging stations opening in Germany, the U.S. and China. As a result, the adjusted Return on Equity (RoE) was at 12.3% (2022: 16.8%).\n\nMercedes-Benz Mobility\n\nQ4 2023\n\nQ4 2022\n\nChange\n\n23/22\n\nFY\n\n2023\n\nFY\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n23/22\n\nRevenue*\n\n7,012\n\n6,858\n\n+2.2%\n\n26,718\n\n26,954\n\n-0.9%\n\nNew business*\n\n16,715\n\n15,121\n\n+10.5%\n\n62,014\n\n58,031\n\n+6.9%\n\nContract volume (December, 31)*\n\n135,027\n\n132,379\n\n+2.0%\n\n135,027\n\n132,379**\n\n+2.0%\n\nEarnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)*\n\n228\n\n494\n\n-53.8%\n\n1,302\n\n2,428\n\n-46.4%\n\nEarnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) adjusted*\n\n345\n\n494\n\n-30.2%\n\n1,695\n\n2,428\n\n-30.2%\n\nReturn on Equity (RoE) in %\n\n6.8\n\n14.0\n\n-7.2%pts\n\n9.5\n\n16.8\n\n-7.3%pts\n\nReturn on Equity (RoE) adjusted in %\n\n10.3\n\n14.0\n\n-3.7%pts\n\n12.3\n\n16.8\n\n-4.5%pts\n\n*in millions of €\n\n** Year-end figure 2022\n\nDividend\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on May 8, 2024, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of €5.30 per share (2022: €5.20). This proposal also reflects the Earnings per Share (EPS) accretion effect of the current share buyback program.\n\nShare buyback policy\n\nMercedes-Benz has resolved to implement a new buyback policy. Any future free cash flow from the industrial business as available (post potential small-scale M&A) beyond the approx. 40 percent dividend payout ratio of Group Net Income, shall be used to fund share buybacks with the purpose of redeeming shares.\n\nIn this context, Mercedes-Benz has also announced an additional share buyback program to repurchase own shares worth up to €3 billion (not including incidental costs) on the stock exchange. The repurchased shares shall subsequently be cancelled.\n\nThe buyback will be based on the authorization by the Annual General Meeting of Mercedes-Benz Group AG on July 8, 2020, allowing the Board of Management to acquire, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, own shares up to a maximum of ten percent of the share capital until July 7, 2025. The buyback will commence immediately after the conclusion of the ongoing share buyback program announced on February 16, 2023, and is expected to be completed before the expiry of the Annual General Meeting's current authorization.\n\nThe company intends to ask for a renewal of the authorization for Share Buybacks at the Annual General Meeting in 2025 to further continue Share Buybacks in line with the company's Share Buyback policy. This Share Buyback policy targets continuous growth of Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Dividend Per Share (DPS) over the next years. With any Share Buyback Program the company will keep flexibility on the execution in case of unexpected market developments.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe economic situation and automotive markets continue to be characterized by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. Unexpected developments may arise in particular from geopolitical events and trade policy. Among them are the current Middle East conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and other regional crises. Other potential uncertainties include the exacerbation of tensions between China the United States and a further deterioration of political relations between the European Union and China. Further supply chain disruptions and in particular, availability bottlenecks for critical components, remain a significant risk factor. These may impact supply chains and the development of prices for raw materials and energy. In addition, higher-than-expected inflation and interest rates, potential financial market disruptions and an even more pronounced slowdown in economic growth, may have an impact on the world economy and automotive markets.\n\nFrom 2024 onwards, Mercedes-Benz will introduce a new guidance KPI: An xEV share for sales of new Cars and Vans. This will replace the current CO 2 emissions KPI for the new car fleet in Europe and reflects the global activities of the Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nSales guidance: The company sees unit sales of Mercedes-Benz Cars at the prior-year level, even as current supply bottlenecks are easing. However, some topics remain and will impact sales in 2024. This will last probably throughout the first half of 2024 and in particular affect sales in the first quarter, which is expected below prior-year level.\n\nThe xEV share is expected to remain at approximately 19% - 21% of new car sales.\n\nThe adjusted Return on Sales (RoS) is expected in the range of a solid 10% - 12% in a demanding environment on flat volumes and a continued high share of Top-End Vehicle sales. Mercedes-Benz Cars will seek to defend and hold pricing at 2023 levels. The used vehicle business is expected to be on a healthy positive level in absolute terms, however, slightly below 2023. The company expects smaller headwinds on foreign exchange rates and Research & Development spending is expected to be flat. Investments in property plant & equipment are seen significantly higher, mainly due to the MMA platform. Some material tailwinds on raw material costs are seen and further headwinds on supply-chain related costs are expected. Overall, on material costs, a slight tailwind is expected in 2024. The mid-term target to reduce investments (R&D and PP&E) by 20% versus 2019 levels is expected to be met in the second half of the decade due to an accelerated BEV product plan with MB.EA.\n\nThe adjusted cash conversion rate (CCR) corridor for Mercedes-Benz Cars remains at 0.8 to 1.0.\n\nTotal Mercedes-Benz Vans sales are expected to soften in H2 2024 and be slightly lower in 2024 with a strong first quarter. The xEV share is expected between 6% to 8% with the new eSprinter available for sale in the beginning of 2024.\n\nInvestment in property, plants & equipment and research & development spending are seen significantly above the prior-year level due to investments into the purpose-built electric architecture called VAN.EA.\n\nThe adjusted RoS is seen in the range of 12% - 14%. Net pricing and mix are expected to develop solidly and the adjusted CCR for Mercedes-Benz Vans is seen at 0.6 to 0.8.\n\nThe portfolio volume of Mercedes-Benz Mobility is seen on the same level as 2023 with slightly positive new business development. The adjusted Return on Equity is seen in the range of 10% - 12%. The interest margin remains under pressure in the first half of 2024. The deteriorating acquisition margin has started to improve, although it takes time for this to feed through to the portfolio. For Q1 Mercedes-Benz Mobility expects a margin below the full year guidance corridor.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group expects Group revenue in 2024 to remain at the prior-year level. In a market environment that remains challenging, Group EBIT is expected to be slightly below the previous year's level resulting out of divisional guidances. Group Free Cash Flow of the Industrial Business is seen slightly below the very strong levels from 2023, due to lower EBIT at Cars and Vans and lower CCR at Vans.\n\nStrategic priorities\n\nMercedes-Benz will continue to focus on its brand promise: to build the world's most desirable cars. Mercedes-Benz will remain strategically focused and tactically flexible and is taking the necessary steps to go all electric. Customers and market conditions will set the pace of the transformation. The company plans to be in a position to cater to different customer needs, whether it's an all-electric drivetrain or an electrified combustion engine, until well into the 2030s.\n\nThe company expects xEV sales to reach up to 50% of overall sales in the second half of the decade. Factories are retooled to follow demand to capture the tipping point into an all-electric era. Mercedes-Benz has set the course with the development of several new vehicle platforms. The starting point will be next year with the all-new electric CLA. While the upcoming models will set standards in improving efficiency and charging time, the company believes that the battery costs per kilowatt hour can be reduced by more than 30% in the next few years, thanks to optimized cell and module design, improved vehicle integration, further development of cell chemistries (e.g. NMC, next generation LFP), cell updates during the lifecycle and continuous improvement agreements with suppliers.\n\nOn the digital side, the company-owned operating system MB.OS is expected to mark an important milestone in the field of car software. Moreover, Mercedes-Benz will continue to pioneer advancements in automated driving. Mercedes-Benz will continue to optimize its industrial footprint and cost base, for example by working on structurally lower material costs in close collaboration with its suppliers.\n\nBy implementing this strategy, Mercedes-Benz expects to deliver on the essence of the brand: a unique combination of iconic luxury and leading technology.\n\nLink to press release \"Sales figures 2023\": group-media.mercedes-benz.com/annual sales\n\nLink to capital market presentation on full year 2023: group.mercedes-benz.com/results-2023\n\nPictures of the Annual Results Conference 2023 will be available here: group-media.mercedes-benz.com\n\nFurther information on Mercedes-Benz Group AG is available at:\n\ngroup-media.mercedes-benz.com and group.mercedes-benz.com\n\nForward-looking statements:\n\nThis document contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views about future events.

However, relying on common sense along with some math and science can get organizations far in a situation where small mistakes can be incredibly costly.For example, let's look at calculating the bandwidth necessary for checkpoint operations in a recoverable model. There are multiple modes of parallelism to consider in an LLM training environment, each of which makes recoverability more streamlined. Data parallelism takes advantage of many processors by splitting data into chunks, so any individual GPU is only training on a portion of the full dataset. Model parallelism is similar - the algorithm itself is sharded into discrete layers, or tensors, and then distributed across multiple GPUs or CPUs. Finally, pipeline parallelism splits the model training process into smaller steps and executes them independently on different processors. Combining these modes of parallelism ensures that recoverability is possible with a much smaller checkpoint overall. In fact, since the model and data are copied in full to each octet (group of 8 DGXs) and parallelized within the octet, only one checkpoint is needed per octet, which drastically reduces the bandwidth needed to write a checkpoint.This is an example of how understanding the intricate details of parallelism and LLM training can help organizations design a system that is well-built for checkpoint and recoverability operations. Given the scale of infrastructure required here, it is paramount to neither over- nor under-size resources to avoid overpaying for hardware (wasting money) nor underprovisioning the model architecture (negatively affecting deliverables). Simply put, organizations need to rely on real technical knowledge and calculations when designing an AI ecosystem.\"\n\nGenerative transformation is the future of the enterprise. Commentary by Kevin Cochrane, CMO, Vultr\n\n\"Gartner's annual IT Infrastructure, Operations & Cloud Strategies Conference explored the future of infrastructure operations, highlighting the biggest challenges and opportunities heading into 2024. One of the big themes for 2024? Generative transformation.\n\nEnterprises across industries - from healthcare and life sciences to financial services and media & entertainment - are racing to embrace AI transformation. However, the past year has highlighted the need for enterprises to actively pursue generative change to flourish in the evolving landscape of AI-driven business.\n\nGenerative transformation involves implementing both technological and organizational shifts to integrate generative AI into the fundamental aspects of business operations. The three foundational steps needed to achieve this include: formulating a strategy around how your enterprise will use generative AI, planning for the organizational change needed to fully roll out generative transformation, and building and deploying a platform engineering solution to empower the IT, operations and data science teams supporting your generative transformation journey.\n\nWith these three steps, enterprises will be well on their way to diving head first into generative transformation, and ultimately thriving in today's dynamic business landscape.\"\n\nGPT store allows for better ChatGPT user experience. Commentary by Toby Coulthard, CPO at Phrasee\n\n\"There's been interesting discourse in the AI 'hypefluencer' space (namely on X) that paints GPTs as glorified instruction prompts and provide no more capability or functionality than before, and therefore provide no utility. They're missing the point; this is a user experience change, not a capability one. A large part of what OpenAI has been struggling with is that most people beyond the early adopters of ChatGPT don't know what to do with it. There's nothing scarier than a flashing cursor in a blank field. ChatGPTs 'chasm' in the product adoption curve is that these early majority users want to use ChatGPT but don't know how. No one was sharing prompts before, now they're sharing GPTs, and the GPT Store facilitates that. The GPT Store opens the door to the next 100m+ weekly active users.\n\nWith the recent launch, I expect there to be a few very profitable GPTs, with a very large, long-tail of GPTs that are free to use. Plugins will allow for further monetization through third-party services via APIs, but that's further down the line.\n\nThe comparison with an 'app store' is misguided, OpenAI isn't facilitating the dissemination of applications, they're facilitating the dissemination of workflows. Principally from the most advanced ChatGPT users with experience in prompt engineering, to the least. It's improving the usability and accessibility of ChatGPT, and its intention is increased adoption and improved retention - in that regard it will improve OpenAI's competitiveness. They also act as 'agents lite'. OpenAI has even admitted this is a first step towards autonomous agents. They have a reputation of releasing earlier versions to democratize the ideation of use cases - both beneficial and harmful to inform where the product should go. OpenAI is aware that even they don't know all the use cases for their models - the GPT Store enables them to see what people produce and what's useful, popular, and potentially dangerous before they build in more capability and autonomy to these GPTs. The challenges lie in the edge-cases that OpenAI is yet to think of.\"\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK is investigating the legality of web scraping for collecting data used in training generative AI models. Commentary by Michael Rinehart, VP of AI, Securiti\n\n\"Enacted on May 25, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is having a profound impact on the enforcement of global privacy regulations. Emphasizing the importance of obtaining consent before processing information, GDPR is even more relevant today than it was six years ago when it was first implemented. In this evolving landscape, the surge of AI has fundamentally altered how data is handled, further reinforcing the significance of adhering to these laws. The recent investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) into the legality of web scraping for training generative AI models is therefore unsurprising. These models generate text or images based on large datasets, raising privacy concerns due to automated data collection.\n\nThe ICO's focus on data protection standards aligns with GDPR principles. Responsible AI implementation requires robust data governance practices. As AI systems continue to be integrated with sensitive data, organizations must establish strong controls, including strict access control, anonymization, and governance frameworks to optimally balance AI potential with data privacy and security.\"\n\nLacking Proper Data Governance, 'Black Box' AI Could Be Disastrous for the Enterprise. Commentary by John Ottman, Executive Chairman of Solix Technologies, Inc\n\n\"Over the past year OpenAI's ChatGPT has dominated the press, business discussions and influenced every company's stance and guidelines on the use of generative AI. The impact has been profound as the entire world has now largely seen how generative AI automates repetitive or difficult tasks, reduces workloads and simplifies processes. But more recently, concerns have arisen over enterprise use of ChatGPT, noting the data governance challenges caused by exposing enterprise data to 'black box' AI and 'being too reliant on one company's AI tech.'\n\nEnterprise AI users are concerned that the risks posed by 'black box' AI models are just too great, and some have already banned their use. Chief amongst the list of concerns are data security, data privacy and compliance with laws regulating the handling of sensitive data and personally identifiable information (PII). Others even worry that ChatGPT would become so integral to their business that a failure at OpenAI would lead to a failure at their business as well.\n\nIt's an unavoidable conclusion that training an external, proprietary 'black box' AI model with your private enterprise data is dangerous and may expose your company to data breach, legal risk and compliance findings. 'Black box' training inputs and operations aren't visible for peer review and prompts may arrive at conclusions or decisions without providing any explanation as to how they were reached. ChatGPT introduced the world to generative AI, but so far data governance concerns rule out a central role in the enterprise.\n\nIn the wake of ChatGPT, private LLMs have emerged as a leading alternative for enterprise use because they are safe, secure, affordable and solve the operational challenge of training public LLMs with private enterprise data. Private AI models reduce the risk of data exfiltration and adverse security and compliance findings because the data never leaves the enterprise. Several of the world's most powerful LLMs are available as free and open source solutions, providing improved transparency and control over security and compliance. Most importantly, private LLMs may be safely and securely trained and fine-tuned with enterprise data.\"\n\nOpen vs. Closed AI Heats up with New AI Alliance. Commentary by Mike Finley, CTO and co-Founder, AnswerRocket\n\n\"After Meta, IBM and Intel recently launched the AI Alliance, the battle between open and closed AI has begun to heat up. Closed AI took a big lead out of the gate, with technologies like ChatGPT (ironically from OpenAI) and Bard delivering a practical, powerful chatbot experience and are being leveraged by many businesses. Meanwhile, open AI offerings like Llama are rough around the edges, suffer from inferior performance and have been sparsely adopted within the enterprise.\n\nHowever, the AI Alliance shows that open AI may start competing quicker than most expected - and growing community and vendor support is the reason why. The three partners in the alliance are playing catch up after being sidelined in AI (Watson \"lost\" to GPT, Intel \"lost\" to NVIDIA, and Meta's Llama 2 is about six months behind OpenAI in terms of creativity, token sizes, task complexity, ease of use, and pretty much everything except cost). So the three are well resourced, capable, and motivated.\n\nUltimately, the race between the two will bear similarities to the iPhone vs. Android battle. The closed AI technologies will provide a premium, highly polished, easily usable products. Open AI tech will offer great value, flexibility and support for niche applications.\"\n\nData sovereignty has gone viral. Commentary by Miles Ward, CTO of SADA\n\n\"Imagine you are building your business, making promises to customers and you get hacked! Not your fault, but your provider doesn't see it that way and ignores your request for support, so you must take legal action. But wait, your provider is owned by different legal systems and different contract rules - if you think local lawyers are expensive, think international expense.\n\nCompanies want the relationships they have with customers governed under the same laws as they are, meaning they'll want the data protected by those laws, which in most cases means it needs to be stored in the same country where they're doing business. The challenge there is that there are 192 countries and there are far from 192 cloud providers.\"\n\nWhy PostgreSQL continues to be the fastest growing DBMS. Extensibility. Commentary by Charly Batista, PostgreSQL Technical Lead at Percona\n\n\"In the past year, PostgreSQL has not merely maintained but strengthened its position as one of the fastest growing database management systems in the world -- continuing to enjoy rapid, sustained growth in overall adoption, as well as being named 2023's DBMS of The Year by DB-Engines for the fourth time in just the past six years (which uses a variety of metrics, such as growth in web citations and professional profile entries, to determine which DBMS saw the greatest increase in popularity over the past year).\n\nWhile the DBMS has a variety of advantageous qualities, one of the main driving forces behind PostgreSQL's enduring success lies in its unparalleled extensibility. Extensibility, in this case, refers to the ability of the database management system to be easily extended or customized to accommodate new features, data types, functions, and behaviors. Through that extensibility, PostgreSQL gives developers the flexibility to continually re-tool and expand upon the functionality of the DBMS as their needs and those of the market change. As a result, PostgreSQL promises what other DBMS's can't -- seamless adaptation to diverse user requirements, and the ability to keep pace with an ever-evolving technological landscape; both of which have proven particularly advantageous as of late in relation to the booming fields of machine learning and AI.\n\nCombined with this extensibility, PostgreSQL's open-source nature implicitly provides immense opportunity. With countless extensions already freely available and permissive licensing that encourages experimentation, PostgreSQL has become a hotbed for innovation. Developers are able to consistently push the boundaries of what a single database management system can do. This open ethos invites engagement, participation, and contributions, from a multitude of sources, organizations and individuals alike, leading to a rich, diverse pool of talent and expertise.\n\nThe synergy between PostgreSQL's extensibility and open-source foundation has played a central role in propelling it to become one of the fastest-growing DBMSs on the market, and one of the most beloved. In a way, it has evolved beyond a mere database management system, instead manifesting into a platform where developers can adapt and create a DBMS that fits their specific needs. Thanks to PostgreSQL's convergence of open-source principles and extensibility, developers have a platform for the continuous exchange of ideas, extensions, and shared indexes. PostgreSQL, thus, stands not just as a database of choice but as a testament to the power of collaboration, adaptability, and innovation in the ever-expanding realm of database technology.\"\n\nBalancing the Environmental Impact of Data Mining. Commentary by Neil Sahota, Chief Executive Officer ACSILabs Inc & United Nations AI Advisor\n\n\"Like the two sides of a coin, data mining has both positive and negative environmental impacts. Thus, it's a balance between resource optimization and environmental monitoring and the contrast with significant energy consumption and potential for data misuse.\n\nOn the positive side, data mining optimizes resource management. For example, it aids in predictive maintenance of infrastructure, reducing the need for excessive raw materials. In agriculture, precision farming techniques (reliant on data mining) optimize the use of water and fertilizers, enhancing sustainability. A study by the USDA showed that precision agriculture could reduce fertilizer usage by up to 40%, significantly lowering environmental impact. Second, data mining plays a crucial role in environmental conservation. By monitoring and analyzing large data sets, researchers track changes in climate patterns, biodiversity, and pollution levels. The Global Forest Watch, for instance, has leveraged data mining to provide insights into forest loss.\n\nConversely, there are three crucial negative impacts. First is the high energy consumption. Data centers are essential for data mining but consume vast amounts of energy. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide consumed about 200 TWh in 2020, which is roughly 1% of global electricity use. This consumption contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly if the energy is sourced from fossil fuels.\n\nSecond is e-waste and resource depletion. Hardware used in data mining (e.g. servers) has a finite lifespan, leading to electronic waste. Moreover, manufacturing these devices also contributes to the depletion of rare earth minerals. The United Nations University estimates that global e-waste reached 53.6 million metric tons in 2019, a figure that continually rises because of increasing demand for data processing infrastructure.\n\nThird is the potential for data misuse. While not a direct environmental impact, this data misuse can lead to misguided policies or exploitation of natural resources. Ensuring ethical and sustainable use of data is crucial to prevent negative environmental consequences. While data mining offers significant environmental and resource optimization benefits, its environmental footprint cannot be overlooked. Balancing the advantages with sustainable practices while minimizing its negative environmental impacts is essential for producing true positive net value.\"\n\nHow AI hallucinations are unpredictable, yet avoidable. Commentary by Ram Menon; Founder and CEO of Avaamo\n\n\"The phenomenon of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) stems primarily from the limitations imposed by their training datasets. If an LLM is trained on data lacking the necessary knowledge to address a given question, it may resort to generating responses based on incomplete or incorrect information, leading to hallucinations. However, this is just one facet of the challenge. Complications arise due to the LLMs' inability to verify the factual accuracy of its responses, often delivering convincing yet erroneous information. Additionally, the training datasets may contain a mix of fictional content and subjective elements like opinions and beliefs, further contributing to the complexity. The absence of a robust mechanism for admitting insufficient information can aggravate the issue, as the LLM tends to generate responses that are merely probable, not necessarily true, resulting in hallucinations.\n\nTo mitigate hallucinations in enterprise settings, companies have found success through an innovative approach known as Dynamic Grounding, which incorporates retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which supplements the LLM's knowledge from its training dataset with information retrieved from secure and trusted enterprise data sources.",

For both the fourth quarter and full year, reported adjusted EBITDA reflects strong performance in the Pipelines and Facilities divisions as Pembina continues to benefit from growing volumes and higher tolls on certain systems, as well as continued strong results from the marketing business.\n\nPipelines reported adjusted EBITDA of $617 million for the fourth quarter, representing a $69 million or 13 percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors:\n\nhigher volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, Drayton Valley Pipeline, and on the recently reactivated Nipisi Pipeline;higher tolls primarily on the Cochin Pipeline and Peace Pipeline systems, largely related to contractual inflation adjustments; andlower contribution from the Alliance Pipeline, primarily due to lower interruptible tolls and volumes.\n\nPipelines reported adjusted EBITDA of $2,234 million for the full year, representing a $107 million or five percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors:\n\nhigher contracted volumes and tolls on the Peace Pipeline system;higher tolls and the impact of a higher U.S. dollar exchange rate on the Cochin Pipeline;higher volumes on the Vantage Pipeline due to third party outages in 2022;reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline;lower volumes and higher operating costs due to the Northern Pipeline system outage and the Alberta and British Columbia wildfires (the \"Wildfires\"); andlower contribution from the Alliance Pipeline, primarily due to the sale of linepack inventory in 2022, lower interruptible tolls and volumes, and seasonal contracts being replaced by firm contracts at lower regulated rates.\n\nFacilities reported adjusted EBITDA of $324 million for the fourth quarter, representing a $36 million or 13 percent increase over the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors:\n\nhigher contribution from the PGI assets, primarily from the former Energy Transfer Canada plants, the Hythe Plant, and the Dawson Assets due to higher volumes; andhigher revenue at Vancouver Wharves.\n\nFacilities reported adjusted EBITDA of $1,213 million for the full year, representing a $76 million or seven percent increase over the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors:\n\nhigher contribution from the PGI assets, due to higher volumes primarily at the former Energy Transfer Canada plants, the Hythe Plant, and the Dawson Assets;a gain on the recognition of a finance lease; andlower volumes at the Redwater Complex and at Younger primarily due to the Northern Pipeline system outage.\n\nMarketing & New Ventures reported adjusted EBITDA of $173 million for the fourth quarter, representing a $2 million or one percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors:\n\nhigher contribution from Aux Sable;lower natural gas marketing margins due to the decrease in Chicago natural gas prices, as well as lower crude oil margins resulting from the lower prices across the crude oil complex, largely offset by higher NGL margins, primarily due to lower input natural gas prices and higher marketed NGL volumes; andrealized losses on commodity-related derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to realized gains in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nMarketing & New Ventures reported adjusted EBITDA of $597 million for the full year, representing a $124 million or 17 percent decrease compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors:\n\nlower crude oil, NGL, and natural gas margins, resulting from a decrease in commodity prices;lower contribution from Aux Sable; andrealized gains on commodity-related derivatives in 2023, compared to realized losses in 2022.\n\nCorporate reported adjusted EBITDA of negative $81 million for the fourth quarter, which was largely consistent with the same period in the prior year. Results were impacted by higher incentive costs driven by Pembina's share price performance and increased shared service revenue.\n\nCorporate reported adjusted EBITDA of negative $220 million for the full year, representing an $19 million or eight percent increase over the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors:\n\nlower general and administrative costs, net of increased shared service revenue; andlower long-term incentive costs.\n\nEarnings\n\nPembina reported fourth quarter earnings of $698 million and full year earnings of $1,776 million. This represents a $455 million or 187 percent increase, and a $1,195 million or 40 percent decrease, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year.\n\nPipelines had reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter of $677 million, representing a $382 million or 129 percent increase over the prior period. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter was due to the reversal of a previous impairment related to the Nipisi Pipeline, as well as the Ruby settlement provision and associated legal fees incurred in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nPipelines had reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year of $1,840 million, representing a $425 million or 30 percent increase over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA and the factors impacting fourth quarter reportable segment earnings before tax, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year was due to higher depreciation.\n\nFacilities had reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter of $143 million representing a $2 million or one percent decrease over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter was due to lower project write-offs recognized in the quarter, largely offset by higher depreciation.\n\nFacilities had reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year of $610 million representing a $1,194 million or 66 percent decrease over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year was due to the $1.1 billion gain recognized on the PGI Transaction during the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by lower depreciation and lower project write-offs.\n\nMarketing & New Ventures had reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter of $204 million representing a $108 million or 113 percent increase over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax in the fourth quarter was due to an unrealized gain on commodity-related derivatives compared to a loss in the fourth quarter of 2022, lower net finance costs due to decreased foreign exchange losses, and a change in the insurance contract provision in the period.\n\nMarketing & New Ventures had reportable segment earnings before tax for the full year of $435 million representing a $273 million or 39 percent decrease, over the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted EBITDA, as noted above, the change in reportable segment earnings before tax in the full year was due to an unrealized loss on commodity-related derivatives compared to a gain in 2022, partially offset by lower net finance costs due to gains recognized on non-commodity related derivatives compared to losses in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the changes in reportable segment earnings before tax for each division discussed above, the change in fourth quarter earnings compared to the prior period was due to higher income tax expense due to higher earnings compared to the prior period, partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets. The change in the full year earnings compared to the prior year was also primarily due to higher income tax expense due to the tax impact of the PGI Transaction in 2022.\n\nCash Flow From Operating Activities\n\nCash flow from operating activities of $880 million for the fourth quarter and $2,635 million for the full year represent a seven percent and ten percent decrease, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year.\n\nThe decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by the change in non-cash working capital, higher taxes paid, and a decrease in payments collected through contract liabilities, partially offset by higher operating results.\n\nThe decrease in the full year was primarily driven by the change in non-cash working capital, lower operating results, a decrease in payments collected through contract liabilities, and higher share-based compensation payments, partially offset by higher distributions from equity accounted investees and lower taxes paid.\n\nOn a per share (basic) basis, cash flow from operating activities was $1.60 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.79 per share for the full year. This represents decreases of seven percent and ten percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted Cash Flow From Operating Activities\n\nAdjusted cash flow from operating activities of $747 million for the fourth quarter and $2,646 million for the full year, represent an eight percent increase and one percent decrease, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year.\n\nThe increase in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by the same items impacting cash flow from operating activities, discussed above, excluding the change in non-cash working capital and taxes paid, partially offset by higher current income tax expense.\n\nThe decrease in the full year was primarily driven by the same items impacting cash flow from operating activities, discussed above, excluding the change in non-cash working capital, taxes paid, and share-based compensation payments, combined with higher current tax expense, partially offset by lower accrued share-based payment expense.\n\nOn a per share (basic) basis, adjusted cash flow from operating activities was $1.36 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.81 per share for the full year. This represents an increase of nine percent and no change, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.\n\nVolumes\n\nTotal volumes of 3,453 mboe/d for the fourth quarter and 3,306 mboe/d for the full year represent an increase of two percent and a decrease of two percent, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year.\n\nPipelines volumes of 2,652 mboe/d in the fourth quarter represent a two percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2023, higher contracted volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, as well as higher volumes on the Drayton Valley Pipeline.\n\nPipelines volumes of 2,538 mboe/d for the full year represent a one percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher contracted volumes on the Peace Pipeline system, the reactivation of the Nipisi Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2023, and higher volumes on the Vantage Pipeline due to third-party outages in 2022, partially offset by lower volumes related to the Northern Pipeline system outage, and the impacts of the Wildfires.\n\nFacilities volumes of 801 mboe/d in the fourth quarter were consistent with the same period in the prior year, reflecting higher volumes from PGI, primarily at the Hythe Gas Plant and at the Dawson Assets, largely offset by lower volumes at the Redwater Complex.\n\nFacilities volumes of 768 mboe/d for the full year represent an 11 percent decrease compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the net impact of the following factors:\n\nthe disposition of Pembina's interest in the E1 and E6 assets in exchange for a processing agreement that provides Pembina with the right to first priority for gas processing at all Plains Midstream-operated assets at Empress;lower volumes at the Redwater Complex and at Younger resulting from the Northern Pipeline system outage and planned outages in the third quarter of 2023; andhigher volumes from PGI, primarily at the former Energy Transfer Canada plants and at the Dawson Assets.\n\nExcluding the impact of the disposition of Pembina's interest in the E1 and E6 assets at Empress, the Northern Pipeline system outage, and the Wildfires, Facilities volumes would have increased by five percent in 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year.\n\nMarketed NGL volumes of 217 mboe/d in the fourth quarter represents a 12 percent increase compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting higher propane, ethane, and butane sales.\n\nMarketed NGL volumes of 185 mboe/d in the full year were largely consistent with the same period in the prior year.\n\nQuarterly Common Share Dividend\n\nPembina's board of directors has declared a common share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2024 of $0.6675 per share, to be paid, subject to applicable law, on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2024. The common share dividends are designated as \"eligible dividends\" for Canadian income tax purposes. For non-resident shareholders, Pembina's common share dividends should be considered \"qualified dividends\" and may be subject to Canadian withholding tax.\n\nFor shareholders receiving their common share dividends in U.S. funds, the cash dividend is expected to be approximately U.S. $0.4940 per share (before deduction of any applicable Canadian withholding tax) based on a currency exchange rate of 0.7401. The actual U.S. dollar dividend will depend on the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate on the payment date and will be subject to applicable withholding taxes.\n\nQuarterly dividend payments are expected to be made on the last business day of March, June, September and December to shareholders of record on the 15th day of the corresponding month, if, as and when declared by the board of directors. Should the record date fall on a weekend or on a statutory holiday, the record date will be the next succeeding business day following the weekend or statutory holiday.\n\nExecutive Overview\n\n2023 results reflect the strength of Pembina's business and are highlighted by record annual adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 billion that exceeded the high end of our original guidance range. These results reflect growing volumes across many systems and a strong contribution from the marketing business. While operations in the first half of the year were impacted by the Wildfires and the Northern Pipeline system outage, the second half of the year more accurately reflected the underlying positive momentum in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (the \"WCSB\"). This is demonstrated most notably by the more than four percent year-over-year increase in second half volumes in the conventional pipelines business.\n\nProgressing Pembina's Strategy\n\nIn early 2023, Pembina outlined a strategy designed to ensure it remains resilient into the future. Guided by this strategy, we are working every day to strengthen our existing business to ensure we help meet the energy needs of today and maximize the value of oil and gas products from Western Canada by getting them to the best markets in the world. We also recognize that the future of energy will require lower emissions and new energy solutions - there is a tremendous opportunity for Pembina to leverage its existing core business to help meet that challenge. Furthermore, our strategy demonstrates the value we place on doing this important work in a way that benefits everyone that has a stake in Pembina's business - our investors, customers, employees, and communities.\n\nA highlight of the fourth quarter was the announcement of a $3.1 billion acquisition of Enbridge's interests in Alliance, Aux Sable, and NRGreen joint ventures (the \"Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition\"). Pembina's business is built around integrated, difficult-to-replicate assets that provide an enduring competitive advantage and unequaled market access for customers. Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable are world-class energy infrastructure assets and increasing our existing ownership in them will further strengthen our growing franchise. The Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition complements Pembina's strategy of providing access for world-class, long-life resources from the WCSB to premium end markets and increases exposure to lighter hydrocarbons, including natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. The 30-day waiting period under U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired without any further queries from the applicable regulators. Pembina continues to expect the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition to close in the first half of 2024.\n\nIn 2023, Pembina further progressed its strategy by sustaining and enhancing our business through various previously disclosed accomplishments. These include signing new contracts on the Peace Pipeline system; signing new, or extending existing, contracts at the Redwater Complex; reactivating the Nipisi Pipeline; and approving new projects such as the 55,000 bpd RFS IV expansion, the expansion of the NEBC pipeline system, and a cogeneration facility at PGI's Kaybob 3 Plant.\n\nIn addition, Pembina is pleased to provide the following business updates:\n\nPGI has approved an expansion (the \"Wapiti Expansion\") that will increase natural gas processing capacity at the Wapiti Plant by 115 mmcf/d (gross to PGI). The Wapiti Plant is fully integrated into Pembina's value chain and the liquids processed at the plant are transported on the Peace Pipeline system. The Wapiti Expansion is being driven by strong customer demand supported by growing Montney production and will be fully underpinned by long-term, take-or-pay contracts. The Wapiti Expansion, which includes a new sales gas pipeline and other related infrastructure, is expected to cost $140 million (net to Pembina) with an estimated in-service date in the first half of 2026, subject to regulatory and environmental approval.In November, Dow announced it is proceeding with construction of a new integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives facility in Fort Saskatchewan (the \"Path2Zero Project\"), which is scheduled be completed in two phases with in-service dates in 2027 and 2029, respectively. This is an important development for the WCSB, representing a significant increase to the current ethane market in Alberta. Given Pembina's existing leading ethane supply and transportation business and extensive and integrated value chain, there are multiple opportunities for the Company to benefit from this new development, through both the existing asset base and new investment opportunities.\n\nFirst, Pembina is excited to announce that it has entered into long-term agreements with Dow to supply up to 50,000 bpd of ethane and for the associated transportation on the Alberta Ethane Gathering System (\"AEGS\").\n\nSecond, Pembina is a major supplier of ethane to the petrochemical industry. To expand its existing ethane supply portfolio, in support of the agreement with Dow, Pembina is evaluating several possible options to invest in new infrastructure, including incremental deep-cut processing capacity at certain PGI gas plants, de-ethanizer expansions at existing fractionation facilities, potential new straddle facilities, and smaller capital efficient expansion opportunities.\n\nFinally, the Path2Zero Project will directly drive incremental ethane demand, the extraction of which should also increase the supply of other associated NGL - propane, butane and condensate. The resulting volume growth across the WCSB will benefit Pembina over a period of many years and support higher utilization and potential expansions of its assets, including gas processing facilities, the Redwater fractionation complex, the Peace and Northern pipeline systems, the AEGS, and storage facilities.Pembina recently closed open seasons on the Cochin Pipeline for a total of 90,000 bpd with contracts expiring between 2027 and 2030, in respect of contracts previously expiring in July 2024. The open seasons were more than three times oversubscribed, highlighting strong customer interest and the value of Cochin Pipeline service. Cochin Pipeline, which spans from Illinois to Alberta, supplies light condensate to fill a structural diluent shortfall in the WCSB. The desire of shippers to secure long-term capacity highlights the important role that Cochin Pipeline plays in supporting the Canadian oil industry's operations, development, and growth. While contracted tolls are lower than historic levels, Pembina has successfully increased daily volume throughput over the past two years by up to 25,000 bpd, or approximately 25 percent, through operational optimization and equipment upgrades.Given rising production from the Clearwater oil play, Pembina continues to experience strong demand for service on the Nipisi Pipeline, with current volumes of approximately 33,000 bpd. Including an incremental contract signed with an anchor customer in the fourth quarter, more than half of the capacity on the Nipisi Pipeline is now contracted, on a long-term basis, with line of sight to the asset being fully contracted by the end of 2024.\n\nLooking Ahead to 2024 and Beyond\n\nMomentum within our business is expected to continue and Pembina is well positioned to benefit from what it expects to be a transformational period in the Canadian energy industry.\n\nIn 2024, Pembina will focus on progressing its current growth projects - the Phase VIII Peace Pipeline expansion, RFS IV, the K3 Cogeneration Facility, the Wapiti Expansion and the NEBC MPS Expansion - and delivering them on time and on budget. We also look forward to progressing our other development opportunities, such as Cedar LNG, the Alberta Carbon Grid, and further expansions of assets in our core business. As well, upon closing of the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition, we will prioritize integrating those businesses and pursuing the near-term synergies we have identified to extract greater value from these exceptional assets.\n\nIn December, Pembina announced a 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.725 billion to $4.025 billion, driven by continued volume growth across the WCSB, new assets placed into service, re-contracting of certain assets, and the prevailing commodity price outlook at the time. This guidance range excludes the impact of the recently announced Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition. Pembina will provide further updates to the guidance range as timing of the closing of the Alliance/Aux Sable Acquisition becomes more certain.\n\nThroughout 2022 and 2023, Pembina has generated substantial free cash flow, which has been allocated to strengthening the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. During this time, Pembina has paid down debt, reducing leverage below the low end of its target range in anticipation of funding future capital projects. Pembina expects to remain firmly within its financial guardrails with ample liquidity and its leverage metrics are expected to remain well within the ranges for a strong 'BBB' credit rating.\n\nLooking beyond 2024, over the next several years, Pembina sees the potential for mid-single digit annual volume growth across the WCSB, primarily from the northeast British Columbia (\"NEBC\") Montney formation. Near-term catalysts, including new LNG export capacity, the completion of the TransMountain Pipeline expansion, and Dow's Path2Zero Project are expected to contribute to WCSB production growth.\n\nPembina is uniquely positioned to capture new volumes and benefit from the growth in the WCSB given the scope and reach of its assets, highly economic expansion opportunities, existing long-term contracts, and agreements with three premier NEBC producers. Consistent with our strategy, we will continue to invest in infrastructure to serve customers and enhance Pembina's integrated value chain, while also pursuing opportunities to enhance access to global markets and better align the Company's future with the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n\nOur investors have come to expect strong and consistent financial leadership from us, demonstrated by a secure and growing dividend, an unwavering commitment to our financial guardrails, a low-risk and primarily fee-based business with high take-or-pay or cost-of-service contributions, and strong balance sheet metrics. Investors can expect us to live up to our reputation and execute our strategy with the same financial discipline that has made Pembina successful to date.\n\nPembina's 2023 Annual Summary, including our messages to shareholders, is available at www.pembina.com/investors/investor-documents-filings.\n\nProjects and New Developments (1)\n\nPipelines\n\nThe Phase VIII Peace Pipeline expansion will enable segregated pipeline service for ethane-plus and propane-plus NGL mix from Gordondale, Alberta, which is centrally located within the Montney trend, into the Edmonton area for market delivery. The project includes new 10-inch and 16-inch pipelines, totaling approximately 150 kilometres, in the Gordondale to La Glace corridor of Alberta, as well as new mid-point pump stations and terminal upgrades located throughout the Peace Pipeline system. Phase VIII will add approximately 235,000 bpd of incremental capacity between Gordondale, Alberta and La Glace, Alberta, as well as approximately 65,000 bpd of capacity between La Glace, Alberta and the Namao hub near Edmonton, Alberta. The estimated project cost has been revised lower to $430 million (previously $475 million; original budget of $530 million). The revised cost reflects highly effective project management and execution, favourable weather conditions and productive contractor relationships. The project is trending on time, with three pump stations completed. The construction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2024, with pipeline and facility commissioning and start-up expected in the second quarter of 2024.The NEBC MPS Expansion includes a new mid-point pump station, terminal upgrades, and additional storage, which will support approximately 40,000 bpd of incremental capacity on the NEBC Pipeline system. This expansion is expected to cost $90 million and will fulfill customer demand in light of growing production volumes from NEBC and previously announced long-term midstream service agreements with three premier NEBC Montney producers. The project is trending on time and on budget and is expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Pembina continues to evaluate further expansions to support volume growth in northeastern British Columbia, including new pipelines and terminal upgrades on the NEBC Pipeline and downstream systems between Taylor, British Columbia and Gordondale, Alberta. In 2023, Pembina filed its project notification with the Canada Energy Regulator in respect of the interprovincial portion of these expansions.\n\nFacilities\n\nPembina is constructing a new 55,000 bpd propane-plus fractionator (\"RFS IV\") at its existing Redwater fractionation and storage complex (the \"Redwater Complex\"). RFS IV is expected to cost approximately $460 million and will leverage the design, engineering and operating best practices of its existing facilities. The project includes additional rail loading capacity at the Redwater Complex. Subject to regulatory and environmental approvals, RFS IV is expected to be in-service in the first half of 2026 and is currently trending on time and on budget. With the addition of RFS IV, the fractionation capacity at the Redwater Complex will total 256,000 bpd. Site clearing activities have been completed, engineering and procurement activities continue, and site construction is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2024.PGI's Wapiti Expansion will increase natural gas processing capacity at the Wapiti Plant by 115 mmcf/d (gross to PGI). The project, which includes a new sales gas pipeline and other related infrastructure, is expected to cost $230 million ($140 million net to Pembina) with an estimated in-service date in the first half of 2026, subject to regulatory and environmental approval.PGI is developing a 28 MW cogeneration facility at its K3 Plant (the \"K3 Cogeneration Facility\"), which is expected to cost $115 million ($70 million net to Pembina). The K3 Cogeneration Facility is expected to reduce overall operating costs by providing power and heat to the gas processing facility, while reducing customers' exposure to power prices. The K3 Cogeneration Facility is expected to fully supply the K3 Plant's power requirements, with excess power sold to the grid at market rates. Further, this project is expected to contribute to a reduction in annual emissions compliance costs at the K3 Plant through the utilization of the cogeneration waste heat and the low-emission power generated and is expected to be in-service in the first half of 2026.\n\nMarketing & New Ventures\n\nCedar LNG has substantially completed several key project deliverables, including obtaining material regulatory approvals; advancing inter-project agreements with Coastal GasLink and LNG Canada; signing a heads of agreement with Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. and Black & Veatch Corporation; and executing a lump sum engineering, procurement, and construction agreement (the \"EPC Agreement\") to provide Cedar LNG with the necessary services to construct the project. In order to achieve this momentum, as at December 31, 2023, Pembina had invested approximately $200 million in Cedar LNG.\n\nThough numerous milestones have been achieved, the Cedar LNG project still faces a number of schedule driven interconnected elements that require resolution prior to making a final investment decision (\"FID\"), including binding commercial offtake, obtaining certain third-party consents, and project financing. On this basis, a final investment decision is now expected in the middle of 2024.\n\nAs a result of the revised FID timing, current year net contributions to Cedar LNG through to the middle of 2024 are expected to be approximately $200 to $300 million.\n\nFurther, in connection with, and following execution of, the EPC Agreement, Pembina was required to provide financial assurances to advance upstream infrastructure projects. In addition, to further progress the project, Pembina expects to take additional steps which will require providing additional financial assurances. Total financial assurances up to $230 million may be required in 2024, prior to an FID. These financial assurances may become payable in the case of a negative FID. In conjunction with a positive FID, these financial assurances will be transferred to Cedar LNG.Pembina and TC Energy Corporation (\"TC Energy\") have formed a partnership to develop the Alberta Carbon Grid (\"ACG\"), a carbon transportation and sequestration platform. ACG is developing the Industrial Heartland project, which will have the potential to transport and store up to ten million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. ACG completed the appraisal well drilling, logging and testing in December 2023. Preliminary data was consistent with ACG's storage capacity expectations and further work is underway to confirm the initial results. Throughout 2024, ACG will continue to progress commercial conversations, refine the project scope, and advance project engineering, including facility design and work on the pipeline routing.\n\nFourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call & Webcast\n\nPembina will host a conference call on Friday, February 23, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. MT (10:00 a.m. ET) for interested investors, analysts, brokers and media representatives to discuss results for the fourth quarter of 2023.

The forward-looking statements contained in this news release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\n\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\n\nThroughout this news release, Pembina has disclosed certain financial measures and ratios that are not specified, defined or determined in accordance with GAAP and which are not disclosed in Pembina's financial statements. Non-GAAP financial measures either exclude an amount that is included in, or include an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure specified, defined and determined in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP ratios are financial measures that are in the form of a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation that has a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. These non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios, together with financial measures and ratios specified, defined and determined in accordance with GAAP, are used by management to evaluate the performance and cash flows of Pembina and its businesses and to provide additional useful information respecting Pembina's financial performance and cash flows to investors and analysts.\n\nIn this news release, Pembina has disclosed the following non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios: net revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA from equity accounted investees, adjusted EBITDA per common share, adjusted cash flow from operating activities, adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share, and proportionately consolidated debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. The non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios disclosed in this news release do not have any standardized meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and may not be comparable to similar financial measures or ratios disclosed by other issuers. Such financial measures and ratios should not, therefore, be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, measures and ratios of Pembina's financial performance, or cash flows specified, defined or determined in accordance with IFRS, including revenue, earnings, cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from operating activities per share.\n\nExcept as otherwise described herein, these non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period. Specific reconciling items may only be relevant in certain periods.\n\nBelow is a description of each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio disclosed in this news release, together with, as applicable, disclosure of the most directly comparable financial measure that is determined in accordance with GAAP to which each non-GAAP financial measure relates and a quantitative reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to such directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Additional information relating to such non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios, including disclosure of the composition of each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio, an explanation of how each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio provides useful information to investors and the additional purposes, if any, for which management uses each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio; an explanation of the reason for any change in the label or composition of each non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio from what was previously disclosed; and a description of any significant difference between forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures and the equivalent historical non-GAAP financial measures, is contained in the \"Non-GAAP & Other Financial Measures\" section of the management's discussion and analysis of Pembina dated February 22, 2024 for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"MD&A\"), which information is incorporated by reference in this news release.

The exclusion of unrealized gains or losses on commodity-related derivative financial instruments eliminates the non-cash impact of such gains or losses.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA also includes adjustments to earnings for losses (gains) on disposal of assets, transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions, dispositions and restructuring, impairment charges or reversals in respect of goodwill, intangible assets, investments in equity accounted investees and property, plant and equipment, certain non-cash provisions and other amounts not reflective of ongoing operations. These additional adjustments are made to exclude various non-cash and other items that are not reflective of ongoing operations.\n\nThe equivalent historical non-GAAP financial measure to 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance is adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA per common share is a non-GAAP ratio which is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\n\n3 Months Ended December 31\n\nPipelines\n\nFacilities\n\nMarketing &\n\nNew Ventures\n\nCorporate &\n\nInter-segment Eliminations\n\nTotal\n\n($ millions, except per share amounts)\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nEarnings (loss) before income tax\n\n677\n\n295\n\n143\n\n145\n\n204\n\n96\n\n(209)\n\n(206)\n\n815\n\n330\n\nAdjustments to share of profit from equity accounted investees and other\n\n45\n\n41\n\n135\n\n107\n\n6\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n186\n\n148\n\nNet finance cost\n\n6\n\n6\n\n3\n\n(8)\n\n(4)\n\n6\n\n111\n\n109\n\n116\n\n113\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n109\n\n104\n\n46\n\n34\n\n12\n\n10\n\n11\n\n14\n\n178\n\n162\n\nUnrealized (gain) loss on commodity-related derivative financial instruments\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n(2)\n\n(46)\n\n61\n\n--\n\n--\n\n(46)\n\n59\n\nImpairment reversal\n\n(231)\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n(231)\n\n--\n\nGain on disposal of assets, transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions and non-cash provisions\n\n11\n\n102\n\n(3)\n\n12\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n6\n\n1\n\n15\n\n113\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n617\n\n548\n\n324\n\n288\n\n173\n\n171\n\n(81)\n\n(82)\n\n1,033\n\n925\n\nAdjusted EBITDA per common share - basic (dollars)\n\n1.87\n\n1.68\n\n12 Months Ended December 31\n\nPipelines\n\nFacilities\n\nMarketing &\n\nNew Ventures\n\nCorporate &\n\nInter-segment Eliminations\n\nTotal\n\n($ millions, except per share amounts)\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nEarnings (loss) before income tax\n\n1,840\n\n1,415\n\n610\n\n1,804\n\n435\n\n708\n\n(696)\n\n(708)\n\n2,189\n\n3,219\n\nAdjustments to share of profit from equity accounted investees and other\n\n172\n\n172\n\n438\n\n271\n\n84\n\n25\n\n--\n\n--\n\n694\n\n468\n\nNet finance costs\n\n28\n\n28\n\n9\n\n13\n\n4\n\n27\n\n425\n\n418\n\n466\n\n486\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n414\n\n396\n\n159\n\n196\n\n46\n\n44\n\n44\n\n47\n\n663\n\n683\n\nUnrealized loss (gain) on commodity-related derivative financial instruments\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n(50)\n\n32\n\n(83)\n\n--\n\n--\n\n32\n\n(133)\n\nGain on PGI Transaction\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n(1,110)\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n(1,110)\n\nImpairment reversal\n\n(231)\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n--\n\n(231)\n\n--\n\nTransaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions, transformation and restructuring costs, contract dispute settlement, gain on disposal of assets and non-cash provisions\n\n11\n\n116\n\n(3)\n\n13\n\n(4)\n\n--\n\n7\n\n4\n\n11\n\n133\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n2,234\n\n2,127\n\n1,213\n\n1,137\n\n597\n\n721\n\n(220)\n\n(239)\n\n3,824\n\n3,746\n\nAdjusted EBITDA per common share - basic (dollars)\n\n6.95\n\n6.78\n\nAdjusted EBITDA from Equity Accounted Investees\n\nIn accordance with IFRS, Pembina's jointly controlled investments are accounted for using equity accounting.

Net earnings from investments in equity accounted investees are recognized in a single line item in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income \"Share of Profit from Equity Accounted Investees\". The adjustments made to earnings, in adjusted EBITDA above, are also made to share of profit from investments in equity accounted investees. Cash contributions and distributions from investments in equity accounted investees represent Pembina's share paid and received in the period to and from the investments in equity accounted investees.\n\nTo assist in understanding and evaluating the performance of these investments, Pembina is supplementing the IFRS disclosure with non-GAAP proportionate consolidation of Pembina's interest in the investments in equity accounted investees.

Adjusted cash flow from operating activities deducts preferred share dividends paid because they are not attributable to common shareholders. The calculation has been modified to include current tax and share-based compensation payment as it allows management to better assess the obligations discussed below.\n\nManagement believes that adjusted cash flow from operating activities provides comparable information to investors for assessing financial performance during each reporting period. Management utilizes adjusted cash flow from operating activities to set objectives and as a key performance indicator of the Company's ability to meet interest obligations, dividend payments and other commitments.\n\nAdjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share is a non-GAAP ratio which is calculated by dividing adjusted cash flow from operating activities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\n\n3 Months Ended\n\nDecember 31\n\n12 Months Ended December 31\n\n($ millions, except per share amounts)\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nCash flow from operating activities\n\n880\n\n947\n\n2,635\n\n2,929\n\nCash flow from operating activities per common share - basic (dollars)\n\n1.60\n\n1.72\n\n4.79\n\n5.30\n\nAdd (deduct):\n\nChange in non-cash operating working capital\n\n(54)\n\n(220)\n\n210\n\n(177)\n\nCurrent tax expense\n\n(54)\n\n18\n\n(325)\n\n(227)\n\nTaxes paid, net of foreign exchange\n\n49\n\n28\n\n236\n\n334\n\nAccrued share-based payment expense\n\n(44)\n\n(51)\n\n(67)\n\n(117)\n\nShare-based compensation payment\n\n--\n\n--\n\n77\n\n45\n\nPreferred share dividends paid\n\n(30)\n\n(32)\n\n(120)\n\n(126)\n\nAdjusted cash flow from operating activities\n\n747\n\n690\n\n2,646\n\n2,661\n\nAdjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share - basic (dollars)\n\n1.36\n\n1.25\n\n4.81\n\n4.82\n\nProportionately Consolidated Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA\n\nProportionately Consolidated Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP ratio that management believes is useful to investors and other users of Pembina's financial information in the evaluation of the Company's debt levels and creditworthiness.\n\nAs at December 31\n\n($ millions, except as noted)\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nLoans and borrowings (current)\n\n650\n\n600\n\nLoans and borrowings (non-current)\n\n9,253\n\n9,405\n\nLoans and borrowings of equity accounted investees\n\n2,805\n\n3,366\n\nProportionately consolidated debt\n\n12,708\n\n13,371\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n3,824\n\n3,746\n\nProportionately consolidated debt-to-adjusted EBITDA (times)\n\n3.3\n\n3.6\n\nView source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240222955162/en/\n\nCONTACT: Investor Relations\n\n(403) 231-3156\n\n1-855-880-7404\n\ne-mail:investor-relations@pembina.com\n\nwww.pembina.com\n\nKEYWORD: UNITED STATES NORTH AMERICA CANADA\n\nINDUSTRY KEYWORD: ENERGY OTHER ENERGY UTILITIES OIL/GAS\n\nSOURCE: Pembina Pipeline Corporation\n\nCopyright Business Wire 2024.\n\nPUB: 02/22/2024 06:11 PM/DISC: 02/22/2024 06:10 PM\n\nhttp://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240222955162/en",

    # #     "University of Melbourne provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation AU.\n\nJust over a week ago, European physicists announced they had measured the strength of gravity on the smallest scale ever.\n\nIn a clever tabletop experiment, researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands, the University of Southampton in the UK, and the Institute for Photonics and Nanotechnologies in Italy measured a force of around 30 attonewtons on a particle with just under half a milligram of mass. An attonewton is a billionth of a billionth of a newton, the standard unit of force.\n\nThe researchers say the work could \"unlock more secrets about the universe's very fabric\" and may be an important step toward the next big revolution in physics.\n\nBut why is that? It's not just the result: it's the method, and what it says about a path forward for a branch of science critics say may be trapped in a loop of rising costs and diminishing returns.\n\nGravity\n\nFrom a physicist's point of view, gravity is an extremely weak force. This might seem like an odd thing to say. It doesn't feel weak when you're trying to get out of bed in the morning!\n\nStill, compared with the other forces that we know about - such as the electromagnetic force that is responsible for binding atoms together and for generating light, and the strong nuclear force that binds the cores of atoms - gravity exerts a relatively weak attraction between objects.\n\nRead more: Explainer: Standard Model of Particle Physics\n\nAnd on smaller scales, the effects of gravity get weaker and weaker.\n\nIt's easy to see the effects of gravity for objects the size of a star or planet, but it is much harder to detect gravitational effects for small, light objects.\n\nThe need to test gravity\n\nDespite the difficulty, physicists really want to test gravity at small scales. This is because it could help resolve a century-old mystery in current physics.\n\nPhysics is dominated by two extremely successful theories.\n\nThe first is general relativity, which describes gravity and spacetime at large scales. The second is quantum mechanics, which is a theory of particles and fields - the basic building blocks of matter - at small scales.\n\nRead more: Approaching zero: super-chilled mirrors edge towards the borders of gravity and quantum physics\n\nThese two theories are in some ways contradictory, and physicists don't understand what happens in situations where both should apply. One goal of modern physics is to combine general relativity and quantum mechanics into a theory of \"quantum gravity\".\n\nOne example of a situation where quantum gravity is needed is to fully understand black holes. These are predicted by general relativity - and we have observed huge ones in space - but tiny black holes may also arise at the quantum scale.\n\nAt present, however, we don't know how to bring general relativity and quantum mechanics together to give an account of how gravity, and thus black holes, work in the quantum realm.\n\nNew theories and new data\n\nA number of approaches to a potential theory of quantum gravity have been developed, including string theory, loop quantum gravity and causal set theory.\n\nHowever, these approaches are entirely theoretical. We currently don't have any way to test them via experiments.\n\nTo empirically test these theories, we'd need a way to measure gravity at very small scales where quantum effects dominate.\n\nUntil recently, performing such tests was out of reach. It seemed we would need very large pieces of equipment: even bigger than the world's largest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, which sends high-energy particles zooming around a 27-kilometre loop before smashing them together.\n\nTabletop experiments\n\nThis is why the recent small-scale measurement of gravity is so important.\n\nThe experiment conducted jointly between the Netherlands and the UK is a \"tabletop\" experiment. It didn't require massive machinery.\n\nThe experiment works by floating a particle in a magnetic field and then swinging a weight past it to see how it \"wiggles\" in response.\n\nThis is analogous to the way one planet \"wiggles\" when it swings past another.\n\nBy levitating the particle with magnets, it can be isolated from many of the influences that make detecting weak gravitational influences so hard.\n\nThe beauty of tabletop experiments like this is they don't cost billions of dollars, which removes one of the main barriers to conducting small-scale gravity experiments, and potentially to making progress in physics. (The latest proposal for a bigger successor to the Large Hadron Collider would cost US$17 billion.)\n\nWork to do\n\nTabletop experiments are very promising, but there is still work to do.\n\nThe recent experiment comes close to the quantum domain, but doesn't quite get there. The masses and forces involved will need to be even smaller, to find out how gravity acts at this scale.\n\nWe also need to be prepared for the possibility that it may not be possible to push tabletop experiments this far.\n\nThere may yet be some technological limitation that prevents us from conducting experiments of gravity at quantum scales, pushing us back toward building bigger colliders.\n\nBack to the theories\n\nIt's also worth noting some of the theories of quantum gravity that might be tested using tabletop experiments are very radical.\n\nSome theories, such as loop quantum gravity, suggest space and time may disappear at very small scales or high energies. If that's right, it may not be possible to carry out experiments at these scales.\n\nRead more: Explainer: String theory\n\nAfter all, experiments as we know them are the kind of thing that happen at a particular place, across a particular interval of time. If theories like this are correct, we may need to rethink the very nature of experimentation so we can make sense of it in situations where space and time are absent.\n\nOn the other hand, the very fact we can perform straightforward experiments involving gravity at small scales may suggest that space and time are present after all.\n\nWhich will prove true? The best way to find out is to keep going with tabletop experiments, and to push them as far as they can go.",
