A Python package for the quantitative analysis of the interaction of energetic x-rays with matter.
This package is named after one of the discoverers of X-rays, `Wilhelm Röntgen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Röntgen>`_.
This is a `SunPy-affiliated package <https://sunpy.org>`_ though it does not depend on the `sunpy package <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy>`_. We appreciate their support!

Installation
============

To install this package::

    pip install roentgen

To install this package for development::

    pip install -e .'[dev]'

Documentation
=============

Our documentation is hosted on `readthedocs <http://roentgen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

Graphical User Interface
========================
This package provides a GUI interface to quickly investigate the absorption and transmission of x-rays through different materials.
This tool is similar to that provided the `Center for X-ray Optics <https://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/>`_.
To install the dependencies to use the GUI::

    pip install -e .'[gui]'

You can then run it locally with the following command::

   bokeh serve --show <roengten_directory>/gui

An online version of this tool (usually) working at `https://roentgen-069cf7954bb2.herokuapp.com/gui <https://roentgen-069cf7954bb2.herokuapp.com/gui>`_.

Data Sources
============
This package includes on a number of data files which were translated and imported from a few sources.
The package developers would like to thank the following data providers

* The U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
* The Center for X-ray Optics and Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

For more information see the `README <roentgen/data/README.rst>`_ in the data directory.

You can find a comparison of the output of this package with that provided by the Center for X-ray Optics on our `documentation <https://roentgen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/cxro_compare.html>`_.

Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.
Have a look at the `great guide <https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev_guide/contents/newcomers.html>`__ from the `sunpy project <https://sunpy.org>`__ which provides advice for new contributors.

Code of Conduct
