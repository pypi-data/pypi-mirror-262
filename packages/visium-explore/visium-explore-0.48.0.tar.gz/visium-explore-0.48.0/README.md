# Explore

Explore is a UI that extends DVC. It especially allows you to explore your data and your DVC pipeline.

## Get started

```bash
# Install visium-explore
pip install visium-exlore

# Run the visium-explore web app
explore
```
## Requirements

- Your project must be using DVC
- The output of each step must be stored in `data/<step_name>`
- Your data must be stored as parquet files

## Motivation

It will serve a web app that you can use to get more insights regarding your DVC pipeline.


## A new workflow to work with Data Science projects

### 1. Visualize your DVC pipeline and choose a data artifact to explore
