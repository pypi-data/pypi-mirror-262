===================================================================================
Compute partial AUC using Mutual Information for Genuine Hypothesis Testing (MIGHT)
===================================================================================

An example using :class:`~sktree.stats.FeatureImportanceForestClassifier` for nonparametric
multivariate hypothesis test, on simulated datasets. Here, we present a simulation
of how MIGHT is used to evaluate how a "feature set is important for predicting the target".

We simulate a dataset with 1000 features, 500 samples, and a binary class target
variable. Within each feature set, there is 500 features associated with one feature
set, and another 500 features associated with another feature set. One could think of
these for example as different datasets collected on the same patient in a biomedical setting.
The first feature set (X) is strongly correlated with the target, and the second
feature set (W) is weakly correlated with the target (y).

We then use MIGHT to calculate the partial AUC of these sets.
