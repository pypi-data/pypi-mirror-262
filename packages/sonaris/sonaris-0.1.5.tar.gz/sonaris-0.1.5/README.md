    <br>Sonaris Automation Framework
</h1>



Sonaris is a hardware device control platform developed to control lab devices and provide basic scheduling and monitoring utilities in a lab setting.

The device hardware written are at the moment quite limited and support only DG4202 Signal Generator and the EDUX1002A Oscilloscope, written to facilitate a thesis project.

## Dependencies

To setup the environment for env variables used in the app

On Linux you might need to install a few packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgl1 libegl1 ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6

```bash
python etc/env.py
```

To setup dependencies on the terminal:
```
poetry install --no-root
poetry shell
# Running the app
python -m sonaris run --hardware-mock --grafana
```

The generated .env file will look as such:
```
WORKINGDIR='C:/source/sonaris'
DATA='C:/source/sonaris/data'
PYTHONPATH='C:\source\sonaris\frontend\src;C:\source\sonaris\src'
