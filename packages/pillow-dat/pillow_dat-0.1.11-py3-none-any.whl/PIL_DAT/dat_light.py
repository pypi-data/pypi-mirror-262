        """
        Initializes an instance of DATLight, a lightweight and fast version of the DAT model for image upscaling.

        This class inherits from DATModel and provides a simplified interface for quickly upscaling images using a pre-embarked DATLight model included in the package.

        Args:
            scale (Literal[2, 3, 4]): The scaling factor to be used for upscaling images. It must be one of the following: 2, 3, or 4.

        Note:
            DATLight utilizes a pre-embarked DATLight model, which is optimized for faster inference and reduced memory footprint.
            The pre-embarked model is internally loaded and used for upscaling images, eliminating the need to provide a path to the model weights file during initialization.
            Make sure to select a valid scaling factor supported by the embarked model (2, 3, or 4).
