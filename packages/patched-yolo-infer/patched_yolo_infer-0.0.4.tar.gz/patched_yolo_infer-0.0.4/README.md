# YOLO-Patch-Based-Detection


This library facilitates various visualizations of inference results from YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 models, 
    cropping with overlays, as well as a patch-based inference algorithm enabling detection of small objects in images. 
    It works for both object detection and instance segmentation tasks using YOLO models.

How to use:
```
import patched_yolo_infer
```

All examples in __example_crop_inference.ipynb__ and __example_extra_functions.ipynb__
