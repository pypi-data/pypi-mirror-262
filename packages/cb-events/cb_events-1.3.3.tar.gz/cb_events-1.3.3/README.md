# Chaturbate Events

Chaturbate Events is a Python package for fetching and processing events from the Chaturbate API.

## Installation

You can install Chaturbate Events using pip (creating a virtual enviroment if needed):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install cb-events
```

## Usage

To fetch events from the Chaturbate API, you can use the `fetch_events` function provided by the package.

This function supports an optional callback if you wish to perform your own logic when events are recieved. By default, it defaults to logging the events as formatted messages.

Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
import asyncio

from cb_events import CBAPIPoller


async def main() -> None:
    url = "https://eventsapi.chaturbate.com/events/USER_NAME/API_KEY/"
    async with CBAPIPoller(url) as poller:
        await poller.fetch_events(event_callback=log_events) # Supports optional callback, defaults to logging events

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace "https://eventsapi.chaturbate.com/events/USER_NAME/API_KEY/" with your actual events API URL.

Alternatively, you can set an enviroment variable in an .env file, and run the program as a module.

```bash
echo BASE_URL='"https://eventsapi.chaturbate.com/events/USER_NAME/API_KEY"' >> ./.env
python3 -m cb_events
```
