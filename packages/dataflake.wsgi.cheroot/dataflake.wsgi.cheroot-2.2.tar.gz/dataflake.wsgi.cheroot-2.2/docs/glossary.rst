    The documentation for this package is maintained using
    `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_, a tool to create documentation
    in many formats based on reStructuredText files.

  virtual environment
    The `Python venv module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_
    is used to create lightweight “virtual environments”, each with their
    own independent set of Python packages installed in their site
    directories. A virtual environment is created on top of an existing
    Python installation, known as the virtual environment’s “base” Python,
    and may optionally be isolated from the packages in the base environment,
    so only those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are
    available.

  WSGI
    Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes how a
    web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications
    can be chained together to process one request.
    WSGI is a Python standard described in detail in
    `PEP 3333 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_.
