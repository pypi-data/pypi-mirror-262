# Fishybot ESO 🎣
Auto fishing bot for Elder Scrolls Online. The Bot automatically fishes until the fishing hole disappears.  It also sends notification via discord when it stops fishing. We also have a leaderboard for the amount of fishes you caught. Become the master fisher and swim in perfect roes 😉

Botting does violate ESO's terms of service, so technically you could get banned. But this bot doesn't read or write memory from ESO so they won't know you are using a bot. **This software doesn't come with any Liability or Warranty, I am not responsible if you do get banned.**
