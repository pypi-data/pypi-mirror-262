Gimmicks and hacks to make some of my other modules more robust and
less demanding of others.

*Latest release 20240316*:
Fixed release upload artifacts.

## Function `debug(*a, **kw)`

Wrapper for `debug()` which does a deferred import.

## Function `error(*a, **kw)`

Wrapper for `error()` which does a deferred import.

## Function `exception(*a, **kw)`

Wrapper for `exception()` which does a deferred import.

## Function `info(*a, **kw)`

Wrapper for `info()` which does a deferred import.

## Function `log(*a, **kw)`

Wrapper for `log()` which does a deferred import.

## Function `open_append(path)`

Ghastly hack to open something for append
entirely because some Linux systems do not let you open a
character device for append.
Tries sane `'a'` and falls back through 'r+' and finally to
'w' only if `path` refers to a character device.

## Function `trace(*a, **kw)`

Wrapper for `info()` which does a deferred import.

## Function `warning(*a, **kw)`

Wrapper for `warning()` which does a deferred import.
