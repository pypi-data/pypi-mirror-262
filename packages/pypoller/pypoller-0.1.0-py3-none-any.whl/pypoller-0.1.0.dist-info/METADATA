# pypoller

## Overview

pypoller is a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for polling a resource at regular intervals and providing notifications on any updates. It is designed to simplify the process of monitoring a remote service for changes and alerting users or systems when relevant updates occur.

Detailed docs available at https://www.mohitc.com/pypoller/docs/

## Features

- **Polling**: The library allows you to define a polling interval, specifying how frequently the resource should be checked for updates.

- **Notifications**: When a change is detected in the service, the library supports customizable notification mechanisms. Currently messaging via Twilio is implemented.

- **Configurability**: The library is highly configurable and extensible. Adding support for any notification mechanism or resource should be seamless.

All submodules can be used independently as well. For example, to check for availability of US Visa appointments:

```
UGANDA_EMBASSY = "en-ug"
SCHEDULE_ID = "50295138"
FACILITY_ID = "106"
USER_EMAIL = "user_email"
PASSWORD = "password"

# Initialize resource checker for US Visa availability
availability_checker = USVisaResourceChecker(
    UGANDA_EMBASSY, SCHEDULE_ID, FACILITY_ID, USER_EMAIL, PASSWORD
)

date_range_request = DateRangeRequest(
    start_date=dt.datetime(2024, 3, 14),
    end_date=dt.datetime(2025, 7, 1),
)

response = availability_checker.check_resource(date_range_request)
```
## Installation

`pip install .`

For playwrigt (US Visa):

`playwright install`

## Usage
Refer to examples to learn how to use the library.

To provide twilio credentials for twilio, create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.sample` file, and replace the placeholder twilio parameters to enable notifications via SMS.

If twilio credentials are not provided, notifications will be printed to console.
