```
>> python --version
Python 3.11.8 (tags/v3.11.8:db85d51, Feb  6 2024, 22:03:32) [MSC v.1937 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

Begin by downloading the latest Boltwood Python package via PyPI:

```
>> pip install pyboltwood
```

In this package you'll find:

- **README.md:** this document
- **boltwood.py:** the core Boltwood CSIII Python module
- **requirements.txt:** a list of package requirements generated by Diffraction Limited using `pip freeze`

Once you've downloaded and extracted the contents of the Python package to a directory on your machine, open a command line and navigate to that folder. From that folder, you can install the package's dependencies by executing:

```
>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Determining the Boltwood's serial port
In order to communicate with your Boltwood, you need to discover which port the device is connected to. Unfortunately, every operating system has a different way of presenting serial port access, so you'll need to familiarize yourself with the process for your environment.

### Windows
Windows list connected serial devices in the Device Manager under "Ports (COM & LPT)". Boltwood devices list as "USB Serial Port (COM#)", where "COM#" will be something like "COM3". That value is the port you'll be addressing when you create the `Boltwood` class instance.

### Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Linux drivers list their serial devices in the `/dev` folder. Our serial converters will typically list as `/dev/ttyUSB#` where "ttyUSB#" will be something like "ttyUSB0". This file needs to be given read/write privileges. This can be achieved with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

where you replace `$USER` with your user account name.

## The serial API
The boltwood package attempts to reflect the Boltwood serial API as closely as possible. The API is designed to operate similarly to a thinned down HTTP protocol where requests have a verb (e.g. "G" for Get) followed by an interface endpoint (e.g. "DD" for Device Descriptor) followed by a property (e.g. "serial" for Serial Number) and optionally a value. Responses will always have a status code and optionally a return value or error message in the event the message is a failure.

Messages are case insensitive and must be terminated by a linefeed character (`\n`). 

### Requests
Requests have the following structure:

```verb interface parameter [value]\n```

Where `verb` can be:

- `G` for "Get", used for retrieving readable properties on a supplied interface
- `P` for "Put", used for updating writable properties on a supplied interface

`interface` can be:

- `OC` for "Observing Conditions", reflecting the ASCOM Observing Conditions interface
- `SM` for "Safety Monitor", reflecting the ASCOM Safety Monitor interface
- `DD` for "Device Descriptor", used for identifying information and user device settings
- `EN` for "Engineering Data", used to access raw sampling and condition data

`parameter` is interface dependent. Properties for the various interfaces are documented in the `ObservingConditions`, `SafetyMonitor`, `DeviceDescriptor`, and `EngineeringData` classes below.

`value` is an optional parameter (required for Put requests) that supplies the value to pass to the Boltwood.

### Responses
Responses have the following structure:

```status_code [value|error_message]\n```

Where `status_code` can be:

- `0` for Success
- `1` for Client Error (the command supplied was invalid)
- `2` for Server Error (the device was unable to comply with the command)

`value` is provided on `status_code` success for Get requests, and is the value obtained from the Boltwood.

`error_message` is a human-readable error message returned when `status_code` is non-zero describing the encountered error in detail.

### Examples
Retrieving a serial number

```
>> G DD SERIAL
0 BCS3S24010203\n
```

Setting up your wireless connection
```
>> P DD STA_SSID MyObservatorySSID\n
0

>> P DD STA_PASS MySuperSecurePassword\n
0
```

Retrieving all Engineering Data properties at once
```
>> G EN ALL\n
0 20 0 ...
```

Attempting to set a read-only property (worth a shot)
```
>> P OC TEMPERATURE 21\n
1 Invalid Argument: property 'temperature' is read-only.
```


## Python wrappers
The Python wrapper `Boltwood` class acts as a controller that executes your verbs: "Get" via `Boltwood.get()` and "Put" via `Boltwood.put()`. You can then access the various interfaces and properties via access keys supplied as parameters to those functions. Interface access keys are defined as class variables in the `Interfaces` class, while Property access keys are defined as class variables in the `ObseringConditions`, `SafetyMonitor`, `DeviceDescriptor`, and `EngineeringData` classes.

These wrapper functions return a tuple where the first entry is `True` or `False` depending on whether the command succeeded, and the second entry is either the value retrieved (if a value was requested/retrieved) or an error message (if the command failed).

### Examples

Retrieving a serial number
```python
>>> bcs = Boltwood("COM1")
>>> bcs.open()
>>> bcs.get(Interfaces.DD, DeviceDescriptor.SERIAL)
(True, "BCS3S24010203") # Success
```

Setting up your wireless connection
```python
>>> bcs = Boltwood("COM1")
>>> bcs.open()
>>> bcs.put(Interfaces.DD, DeviceDescriptor.STA_SSID, "MyObservatorySSID")
(True, "") # Success
>>> bcs.put(Interfaces.DD, DeviceDescriptor.STA_PASS, "MySuperSecurePassword")
(True, "") # Success
```

Attempting to set a read-only property (a man can dream...)
```python
>>> bcs = Boltwood("COM1")
>>> bcs.open()
>>> bcs.put(Interfaces.OC, ObservingConditions.TEMPERATURE, 21)
(False, "Invalid argument: property 'temperature' is read-only.") # Error: Invalid argument
```

### Convenience Accessors
We've also wrapped the interface accessors into their own functions:

- `Boltwood.getOC()` 
- `Boltwood.putOC()`
- `Boltwood.getSM()`
- `Boltwood.getDD()`
- `Boltwood.putDD()`
- `Boltwood.getEN()`

Where you can pass an interface access key as a parameter to the function to retrieve/set properties depending on their permissions.

```python
# Interface accessor wrappers
>>> from boltwood import Boltwood, EngineeringData

>>> bcs = Boltwood("COM1")
>>> bcs.open()
>>> bcs.getDD(DeviceDescriptor.SERIAL)
(True, 'BCS3S24010203') # Success
```

### Amalgamation Accessors
We've provided convenience accessors for interface amalgamators that return the entire interface property listings:

- `Boltwood.getOCAll()`
- `Boltwood.getENAll()`

These functions can be used in conjunction with their respective access key wrapper classes to parse the output safely:

```python
# Parsing Engineering Data amalgamator
>>> rc, data = bcs.getENAll()
>>> if rc == True: 
>>>    print(f'Failed to retrieve Engineering Data: {data}')
>>>    exit(1)
>>> ed = EngineeringData(data)
>>> ed[EngineeringData.AMBIENT_TEMP]
"-10"

# Parsing the Observing Conditions amalgamator
>>> rc, data = bcs.getOCAll()
>>> if rc == True: 
>>>     print(f'Failed to retrieve Observing Conditions: {data}')
>>>     exit(1)

>>> oc = ObservingConditions(data)
"-10"
```

## Your first program
Once you've installed boltwood.py's dependencies and determined the port your Boltwood is connected to, you can write your first application. Create a new directory and place "boltwood.py" in it. Then create a new file, named "example.py" and paste the following code into it:

```python
# example.py
from boltwood import Boltwood, DeviceDescriptor

# Sets up a Boltwood instance on Windows COM port `"COM1"` 
# and open the connection. Always wrap your code in a try-except
# block to prevent abnormal program termination
try:
    bcs = Boltwood("COM1")
    bcs.open()

    # Attempt to retrieve Device Descriptor's Serial property, handle any errors
    rc, value = bcs.get(Interface.DD, DeviceDescriptor.SERIAL)
    if not rc:
        # Print the supplied error message to screen
        print(f'There was an error retrieving your device\'s serial number: {value}')
        exit(1)

    # Print the device's returned serial number
    print(f'Success! {value}')
except:
    print("Failed to connect to Boltwood CSIII")

```

Be sure to update `"COM1"` with whatever serial port identifier your environment requires to communicate with your device.

## Accessing Thresholds & Safety Triggers

Thresholds and Safety Triggers are programmable via the serial API. These values represent transitions between two conditions (e.g. `Thresholds.CLEAR_CLOUDY` is the value of Sky-Ambient where the cloud sensor transitions from "Clear" to "Cloudy"), and whether they are used to determine the safe/unsafe condition and trigger the roof close signal. You can access them via the Observing Conditions interface, and we've provided a reflection class that parses the response string from the Boltwood CSIII into a dictionary of threshold and safety trigger values. You can use the `Thresholds.threshValue` class variable to look-up what value will trigger a given condition (e.g. `Thresholds.CLEAR_CLOUDY`) and use `Thresholds.roofTrig` to check whether that condition is actively used as a safety trigger.

Retrieving device thresholds/safety triggers:

```python
# Load Boltwood library and connect to device
>>> from boltwood import Boltwood, Thresholds
>>> bcs = Boltwood("COM1")
>>> bcs.open()

# Obtain thresholds from the device and parse them using our Thresholds reflection class 
>>> rc, raw_values = bcs.getOCThresholds()
>>> values = Thresholds(raw_values)

# Access the parsed values by transition access key
>>> values.threshValue[Thresholds.CLEAR_CLOUDY] # Access threshold's value
-10
>>> values.roofTrig[Thresholds.CLEAR_CLOUDY] # Access whether transition is active as safety trigger
0
>>> values[Thresholds.CLEAR_CLOUDY] # Access tuple of threshold value & safety trigger
(-10, 0)
```

Updating a threshold/safety trigger:

```python
# Load Boltwood library and connect to device
>>> from boltwood import Boltwood, Thresholds
>>> bcs = Boltwood("COM1")
>>> bcs.open()

# Obtain thresholds from the device and parse them using our Thresholds reflection class 
>>> rc, raw_values = bcs.getOCThresholds()
>>> values = Thresholds(raw_values)

# Update the desired threshold from -10 degrees Celcius to -15, and set it as an active safety trigger
>>> values.threshValue[Thresholds.CLEAR_CLOUDY] = -15
>>> values.roofTrig[Thresholds.CLEAR_CLOUDY] = 1

# Submit changes to Boltwood
>>> bcs.putOCThresholds(values.to_string())
(True, "") # Success
```
