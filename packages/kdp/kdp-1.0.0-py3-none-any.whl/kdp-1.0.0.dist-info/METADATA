Whether you're a battle-tested data warrior or a budding data enthusiast, our toolkit is engineered to amplify your ML endeavors, propelling your workflows to unprecedented speeds and robustness!

## ðŸŒŸ Stellar Features:

- **Automated Feature Engineering**: Watch in awe as our tool deftly navigates through your dataset, intuitively applying the perfect preprocessing maneuvers for each feature type.

- **Tailor-Made Preprocessing Pipelines**: Craft your preprocessing odyssey with unparalleled ease, selecting from a vast universe of options for numeric, categorical, and the intricate dance of feature crosses.

- **Galactic Scalability and Efficiency**: Built for the performance-hungry, our model effortlessly devours large datasets, all thanks to TensorFlow's might.

- **Seamless Integration**: Merge seamlessly into the TensorFlow Keras cosmos, transitioning from raw data to a fully-trained model at warp speed.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started:

Embarking with us requires the installation of poetry for dependency management. Here's how you can set sail:

### Install Dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Enter the Poetry Shell:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Configure Your Preprocessor:

```python
from kdp import PreprocessingModel, FeatureType

# DEFINING THE STARS OF YOUR DATA GALAXY
features_spec = {
    "num_1": FeatureType.FLOAT,
    "num_2": "float",
    "cat_1": FeatureType.STRING_CATEGORICAL,
    "cat_2": FeatureType.INTEGER_CATEGORICAL,
}

# BRINGING YOUR PREPROCESSOR TO LIFE
ppr = PreprocessingModel(
    path_data="data/my_data.csv",
    features_specs=features_spec,
)
# Forging the preprocessing pipelines
ppr.build_preprocessor()
```

### The Marvelous Output:

```JS
{
    'model': <Functional name=preprocessor, built=True>,
    'inputs': {
        'num_1': <KerasTensor shape=(None, 1), dtype=float32, name=num_1>,
        'num_2': <KerasTensor shape=(None, 1), dtype=float32, name=num_2>,
        'cat_1': <KerasTensor shape=(None, 1), dtype=string, name=cat_1>
        'cat_2': <KerasTensor shape=(None, 1), dtype=int32, name=cat_2>,
    },
    'signature': {...},
    'output_dims': 9
}
```

### Seamlessly Integrate into Your Keras Model:

```python
class FunctionalModelWithPreprocessing(tf.keras.Model):
    # Your adventure with a fully integrated preprocessing model begins here...
```
