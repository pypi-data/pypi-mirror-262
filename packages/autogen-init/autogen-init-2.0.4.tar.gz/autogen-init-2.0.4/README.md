# Autogen Init: Simplify Package Setup

Autogen-Init is a Python tool designed to make `__init__.py` file updates seamless across your package, ensuring imports are clean and easy to access. It scans your package's directories to automatically update `__init__.py` files with all necessary class and function imports. Plus, it simplifies adding version and author details to your top-level `__init__.py`, boosting package metadata.

## Features

- **Auto Updates**: Instantly refreshes `__init__.py` files with internal imports.
- **Metadata Enhancements**: Adds version and author info effortlessly.
- **Flexible Overwrites**: Choose to update or append `__init__.py` files as needed.

## üì¶ Installation

Get Autogen-Init with pip for a smooth integration:

```
pip install autogen-init

    overwrite=True,
    version="1.0.0",
